FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to a method for preparing siloxanes having glycerol modifications and also at the same time hydrophobic substituents. The present invention further relates to a siloxane having glycerol modifications and also hydrophobic side chains, wherein the glycerol modifications bear at least partially ketal groups, and also the use of these novel siloxanes.
PRIOR ART
Organomodified siloxanes are used in various applications. Their properties can be adjusted by the type of modification and also by the specific modification density.
The noble metal-catalysed hydrosilylation reaction represents a universal methodology for the SiC bond forming modification of siloxane skeletons having SiH groups.
For instance, in this manner, with allyl polyethers for example, organophilic or non-ionic hydrophilic groups may be bonded to a siloxane skeleton. Such compounds are used, for example, as polyurethane foam stabilizers and as defoamers in propellants.
In contrast, by reaction with α-olefins, the siloxane can be attached to lipophilic groups. The silicon waxes obtained thereby serve, for example as additives in cosmetic applications.
Since polyether-containing compounds have come under increasing criticism in recent times, there exists a need for siloxane-based emulsifiers which bear no polyether groups but at the same time have good emulsifying and dispersing properties.
For this purpose, glycerol or polyglycerol derivatives are used to replace the polyether groups as hydrophilic component. Polyglycerol-modified siloxanes of this kind are described, for example, in EP 1213316. In the application EP 1550687, glycerol-modified siloxanes are used for application in emulsions.
EP 1550687 discloses that glycerol-modified, particularly polyglycerol-modified siloxanes may be prepared directly by hexachloroplatinic acid-catalyzed SiC linkage of lateral hydrogen siloxanes with polyglycerol mono- or polyglycerol diallyl ethers in isopropanol as reaction medium. In this case, SiOC linked hydrolysable secondary products are inevitably formed.
EP2243799 addresses this problem and teaches that the weaknesses of systems known hitherto can thus be prevented by carrying out the linkage of the glycerol derivative not in comb positions but at the termini of the siloxane skeleton to be modified.
Despite the teaching presented in this document, no technical solution for the preparation of high-purity glycerol-modified siloxanes is presented. The general procedure described therein for the preparation of alkyl/glycerol-modified siloxanes follow in that stoichiometric excesses of α-olefin and glycerol monoallyl ether and 10 ppm Karstedt's catalyst are initially charged in ca. 30% toluene (based on the total weight) with stirring and heated to 95° C. The hydrogen siloxane is then added dropwise at 95° C. over 2 hours. After distillative workup of the reaction mixture having complete SiH conversion (stripping off volatile components at 110° C. and with the aid of an applied vacuum of ca. 1 mbar), a viscous, slightly cloudy, almost colorless product is obtained.
The use of aromatic solvent is of sufficient disadvantage for this method if the resulting siloxane is intended to be used as a cosmetic additive. In addition, by means of the reaction regime, in which an ambident substrate such as glycerol monoallyl ether is combined with the SiH siloxane in the presence of a platinum catalyst, hydrolytically unstable SiOC linked secondary products are formed. These secondary products, due to their chemical relationship to the main products and their non-volatility, are not separable from the product and therefore remain therein. Nonetheless, secondary product formation accounts for up to ca. 25 val % of the glycerol monoallyl ether used.
As a result, the achievable selectivity for the SiC linkage always lags behind that theoretically expected.
Recognising the difficulty resulting from the presence of the ambident substrate, the teaching of WO 2011134869 is directed to the use of 1,2-O-isopropylidene-3-allyloxy-1,2-propanediol as modifying reagent of comb-like structured SiH siloxanes (Examples 1a, 2a, 3a). Although only the ketal moiety is to be added as sole substituent on the respective hydrogen siloxane, the use of a large amount of dioxane is necessary (ca. 78% in Example 1a, ca. 71% in Example 2a and ca. 57% in Example 3a) in order to isolate after more than 24 hours yields of 88 to 92% of the glycerol-modified siloxane still to be protected.
The object given to providing diacrylate group-bearing siloxanes for use in radiation-curing systems, U.S. Pat. No. 4,908,228 addresses the reaction of 1,2-O-isopropylidene-3-allyloxy-1,2-propanediol with hydrogen silanes and hydrogen siloxanes and limits itself in this case to the consideration of purely binary substance systems. The glycerol ketal-modified silanes and siloxanes obtained are subsequently subjected to a hydrolysis or alcoholysis and the diol-modified siloxanes released are acrylated.
The object of the invention was to provide a method with which glycerol-modified siloxanes can be prepared without the use of relatively large amounts of solvent, which additionally have hydrophobic substituents.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the method described below for preparing siloxanes having glycerol modifications and at the same time hydrophobic substituents, may be a carried out without large amounts of solvent. Completely surprisingly, the reactants used in the method according to the invention result in an unforseeably high phase compatibility. Typically, hydrosilylation reactions carried out without solvent are characterized by a substrate-dependent incompatibility, which leads to the fact that the SiC linkage reaction starts from the multiphasic state, generally from a biphasic state. The silicone phase having SiH groups and the olefinic reaction partner to be added on have no affinity due to their different polarities from each other and are in addition separated more by density differences. For instance, the solvent-free SiC linkage reaction between SiH siloxanes and unsaturated (poly)ethers can be cited, which always begins biphasically. With the starting formation of the SiC linked copolymer, a phase-compatibilizing surfactant is present which promotes the dispersal of the reaction partners at the phase interface. With the product concentration increasing during the reaction course, the concentration of incompatible reactants falls, which permeate the reaction matrix in the form of small droplets. At the so-called clearing point, the diameter of the individual droplets of the incompatible dispersed phase has fallen below the wavelength of visible light and the previously cloudy reaction matrix appears to the naked eye to be a clear phase.
Knowing the practical experiences in the SiC bond forming (poly)ether modification of siloxanes, phase compatibility of the addenda in the hydrosilylation step in the preparation of the inventive claimed siloxanes bearing simultaneously glycerol, glycerol ketal and hydrophobic substituents represents a surprise to those skilled in the art, since formally glycerol monoallyl ether ketal—detached from its preparation and questions of nomenclature—is considered as an unsaturated (poly)ether compound having 3 ether oxygen atoms. In place of the biphasicity of the reaction matrix usually observed in (poly)ether additions—and from the start of the hydrosilylation—an undifferentiated clear homogeneous phase is apparent to the naked eye. For operational practice, this system behavior is of exceptional importance, since it avoids the necessity to use solvent and/or to attach the reaction partners to the polymer skeleton in a complex sequence, as is described, for example, in the production Example 1 of WO2013103147, page 49 ff.
The present invention therefore relates to a method for preparing modified siloxanes comprising the method steps of
A) providing a hydrogen siloxane having at least three SiH groups per molecule;
B) hydrosilylation of the hydrogen siloxane with
at least one α-olefinic hydrocarbon having 2 to 36, particularly 8 to 28, carbon atoms and
at least one ketalized glycerol derivative comprising:
a glycerol skeleton and
one α-olefinic coupling group; and optionally
C) purifying the hydrosilylated siloxane; and optionally
D) at least partial acidic hydrolysis of the ketals present in the ketalized glycerol derivatives reacted with the hydrogen siloxane.
The invention further relates to a modified siloxane obtainable by the aforementioned method, and also the use of the same as emulsifier.
An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that the glycerol-modified siloxanes with regard to SiOC linked secondary products can be prepared in high purity. A further advantage of the method according to the invention is that the glycerol-modified siloxanes obtainable are able to achieve excellent emulsions and dispersions. Such formulations are stable in storage and the emulsions or dispersions show over a period of several months and at different temperatures a constantly stable composition and homogeneity without separation of oil or water or solid. The glycerol-modified siloxanes obtainable have proven to be particularly advantageous especially in cosmetic emulsion preparations for make-up and sun protection applications, which additionally comprise inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide or iron oxide, since the glycerol-modified siloxanes obtainable impart to these formulations a good long-term stability and a very good pigment dispersion.
A further advantage of the method according to the invention is that it affords a constant and reproducible quality of the end product, which was achievable only with difficulty, it at all, by the industrial methods for preparing glycerol-modified siloxanes known to date.
The preparation process according to the invention and the glycerol-modified siloxanes according to the invention are described below by way of example without the invention being limited to these exemplary embodiments. When ranges, general formulae or classes of compounds are specified below, these are intended to encompass not only the corresponding ranges or groups of compounds which are explicitly mentioned but also all subranges and subgroups of compounds which can be derived by leaving out individual values (ranges) or compounds. Where documents are cited for the purposes of the present description, the entire content of these is intended to be part of the disclosure of the present invention. Where, in the context of the present invention, compounds, such as siloxanes, are described which can have different units multiple times, then these can occur in random distribution (random oligomer) or arranged (block oligomer) in these compounds. Data on the number of units in such compounds are understood to be as averages, averaged over all relevant compounds, since in particular siloxanes are generally present as mixtures.
Unless stated otherwise, all percentages (%) given are percentages by mass.
The method for preparing modified siloxanes according to the invention is particularly oriented to the preparation of the siloxanes having at least one long-chain hydrocarbon group and at least one group containing glycerol.
In the context of the present invention, the term “hydrogen siloxane” or “H-siloxane” is always understood to mean SiH functional siloxane. The hydrogen siloxanes used in accordance with the invention are obtainable by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, the equilibration such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,196,153.
In the context of the present invention “ketalized” glycerol derivatives are understood to mean that OH groups of the glycerol derivative belonging to the glycerol portion have been formally converted by reaction with at least one ketone into a ketal. In this context, in the ketalized glycerol derivatives, at least some of the OH groups have been ketalized; preferably at least 5%, in particular at least 15% of the OH groups have been ketalized.
The structure of the siloxane base skeleton of the modified siloxane to be prepared by the method according to the invention is obviously determined by the hydrogen siloxane used in method step A).
The modified siloxane preferably has 20 to 300, particularly preferably 50 to 150 Si atoms per molecule.
In the siloxane skeleton, linear, branched and also dendritic siloxanes may be modified by the method according to the invention.
Appropriate dendritic siloxanes, which may be obtained by partial hydrosilylation of hydrogen siloxanes with branched siloxanes bearing olefin groups e.g. vinyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane and may be used in method step B), are described, for example, in WO2013103147.
For instance, in analogy to the teaching of WO2013103147, a monoglycerol-modified dendritic siloxane according to the present invention can be obtained by adding vinyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane, an α-olefin and glycerol ketal monoallyl ether, hydrosilylating for example on a lateral hydrogen siloxane and the addition product is subsequently subjected to a partial deketalization.
The addition of the olefinic reaction partner in method step B) can be sequenced in any desired sequence or preferably be carried out concertedly.
A preferred method according to the invention serves to prepare modified siloxanes of the general formula I)
M2+h+2i-a-b-cM′aM″bM′″cDdD′eD″fD′″gThQi  general formula I)
where
M=(R13 Si O1/2),
M′=(R12R2 Si O1/2),
M″=(R12R3 Si O1/2),
M′″=(R12R4 Si O1/2),
D=(R12 Si O2/2),
D′=(R1R2 Si O2/2),
D″=(R1R3 Si O2/2),
D′″=(R1R4 Si O2/2),
T=(R1 Si O3/2) and
Q=(Si O4/2),
where
R1=mutually independent, identical or different, linear or branched, optionally aromatic hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 16, preferably 1 to 7, carbon atoms, which optionally bear OH or ester functions, or tris(trimethylsiloxy)silane ethyl, preferably methyl, phenyl or tris(trimethylsiloxy)silane ethyl, in particular methyl or tris(trimethylsiloxy)silane ethyl,
R2=mutually independent, identical or different, linear or branched, optionally aromatic hydrocarbon radicals having 2 to 36 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 28 carbon atoms, preferably linear alkyl radicals having 8 to 28 carbon atoms, particularly n-dodecyl or n-hexadecyl, and
R3=mutually independent, identical or different, selected from glycerol-containing radicals,
R4=mutually independent, identical or different, selected from ketalized glycerol-containing radicals,
where
a=0 to 7, particularly 0 to 3,
b=0 to 7, particularly 0 to 3,
c=0 to 7, particularly 0 to 3,
d=10 to 200, preferably 20 to 150, particularly 50 to 130,
e=1 to 130, preferably 5 to 80, particularly 8 to 40,
f=0 to 75, preferably 1 to 45, particularly 1 to 25,
g=0 to 75, preferably 1 to 45, more particularly 4 to 25,
h=0 to 10, preferably 0 to 5, especially 0
i=0 to 5, preferably 0 to 2, particularly 0,
with the proviso that c+g>0.
The result of this for the method according to the invention, as already explained above, is that preferably such hydrogen siloxanes are provided in method step A) which correspond to the aforementioned general formula I), in which R2, R3 and R4═H.
It is apparent that the α-olefinic hydrocarbon used in method step B) determines the structure of the radical R2 and the ketalized glycerol derivative used in method step B) determines the structure of the radical R3 and R4.
In method step B) therefore, preferably linear α-alkenes having 8 to 28 carbon atoms, in particular n-dodecene or n-hexadecene are used as α-olefinic hydrocarbons.
In the context of the present invention, it is apparent that the radical R3 is a glycerol-containing radical, which clearly has not been ketalized to R4.
The term “glycerol-containing radical” in the context of the present invention is understood to mean a substituent which comprises the structure —OCH2CH(O—)CH2O—.
Analogous structures are understood in the context of the present invention under the term “glycerol skeleton”.
In method step B), the hydrosilylation of the hydrogen siloxane with the α-olefinic hydrocarbon and the ketalized glycerol derivative can be carried out simultaneously or separately from one another, i.e. in any successive sequence, although it is preferred in accordance with the invention if in method step B) the hydrosilylation of the hydrogen siloxane is carried out with a mixture comprising the α-olefinic hydrocarbon and the ketalized glycerol derivative.
In method step B), the hydrosilylation can be carried out in the presence of a catalyst according to established methods. It is possible to use, for example, catalysts such as complexes of platinum, rhodium, osmium, ruthenium, palladium, iridium or similar compounds or the corresponding pure elements or derivatives thereof immobilized on silica, aluminium oxide or activated carbon or similar support materials. The hydrosilylation is preferably carried out with the aid of platinum complexes such as cis-(NH3)2PtCl2 (cisplatin), di-μ-[chlorobis chloro(cyclohexene)platinum(II)] or [tris(divinyltetramethyldisiloxane)bisplatin(0)] (Karstedt's catalyst) and particularly preferably with olefin-activated platinum(0) complex catalysts (so-called WK catalysts) according to the teaching of EP1520870. The amount of catalyst is calculated in this case such that the total concentration of platinum is from 1 to 100 wppm, based on the total reaction mixture. As is apparent to those skilled in the art, the minimum platinum concentration is selected so that a rapid SiC bond forming reaction is ensured, without the economic viability of the method being affected by excessively high noble metal use or by also causing disadvantageous product discolorations. The hydrosilylation may be carried out at temperatures between 0 and 200° C., preferably between 50 and 140° C. The reaction may be carried out in suitable solvents such as aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic oligosiloxanes, alcohols, carbonates or esters. Suitable processes for hydrosilylation are described, for example, in the book “Chemie und Technologie der Silicone” [Chemistry and Technology of the Silicones], Verlag Chemie, 1960, page 43, and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,775,452, to which express reference is made.
In contrast to the methods known to date, the use of a solvent can be omitted in method step B).
It is therefore preferred according to the invention that in method step B) at most 20% by weight, preferably at most 10% by weight, in particular at most 5% by weight solvent is used, wherein the percent by weight refers to the sum total of hydrogen siloxane, α-olefinic hydrocarbon, ketalized glycerol derivative and solvent.
The ketalized glycerol derivative preferably used in method step B) is derived structurally preferably by ketalizing with substances selected from the group R′—(CO)—R″ where R′ and R″ are identical or different hydrocarbon radicals, in particular alkyl groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, benzaldehyde, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and cycloheptanone.
The boiling point differences of the ketalization reagents used and considering conversion products thereof, it has proven advantageous in practice if the preparation of the ketalized glycerol derivative is not carried out using the corresponding ketone itself, but with corresponding ketals thereof. Preference is given to using dimethoxy or diethoxy ketals in this case.
Methods for preparing cyclic acetals and ketals are disclosed in DE19648960 and in DE19647395. Directions for carrying out the ketalization over solid catalysts are disclosed, for example, in DE102008015756. WO2009010527 relates to a method for preparing cyclic glycerol acetals or cyclic glycerol ketals or mixtures of the same.
In method step B) preferably a ketalized glycerol derivative is used having the general formula II)
where R′ and R″ are identical or different hydrocarbon radicals, in particular alkyl groups having 1 to 20, in particular 1 to 4, carbon atoms, wherein R′ and R″ can be covalently bonded to each other via a C—C bond, and X is selected from divalent hydrocarbon radicals, in particular alkylene groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, where ×=CH2 is particularly preferred.
In the case that R′ and R″ are covalently bonded to each other via a C—C bond, the sum total of the carbon atoms of R′ and R″ is preferably 4 to 7 carbon atoms, especially preferably 4 carbon atoms, particularly preferably R′ and R″ together are in the form of an alkylene group having 4 to 7 carbon atoms.
In method step B), very particular preference is given to using a ketalized glycerol derivative of the general formula II) where ×=CH2 and R′ and R″=CH3.
Particularly preference is given to using the aforementioned preferred ketalized glycerol derivative in connection with a method according to the invention for preparing siloxanes of the general formula I) where
R1=methyl,
R2=in particular n-dodecyl or n-hexadecyl,
and
a=0 to 3,

d=50 to 130,
e=8 to 40,
f=1 to 25,

h=0, and
i=0.
It can be of advantage if the modified siloxane is purified after method step B). This is achieved preferably by distilling off of excess α-olefinic hydrocarbons and ketalized glycerol derivatives and optionally solvent.
In method step C), the ketals present in the modified siloxane are optionally at least partially acid hydrolyzed. Appropriate directions for carrying out the acidic hydrolysis are disclosed, for example, in WO2011134869.
The hydrolysis is carried out by addition of an aqueous acidic solution, in particular a toluenesulphonic acid solution. It is advantageous and therefore preferred in accordance with the invention, if method step C) is carried out at a temperature of 40° C. to 100° C.
Of all possible preferences according to the invention, method step C) is carried out such that the degree of ketalization is from 5% to 70%, preferably 10% to 40%, particularly preferably 15% to 25%, wherein the percentage refers to all diols suitable for ketalization present in the siloxane. The degree of ketalization can be determined with the aid of 1H-NMR spectroscopy.
By way of preference in accordance with the invention, the method according to the invention can include a further method step D) in which the modified siloxane is purified.
Method step D) according to the invention preferably includes neutralization of the acid used for the acidic hydrolysis in method step C), followed by removal of the salts thus formed. This is preferably carried out according to the invention in the form of a filtering off of the salt. Also preferred in accordance with the invention is a distillative removal of the further substances added in step C) and predicted by-products formed. These include particularly water and ketones.
The present invention further relates to siloxanes obtainable by the method according to the invention which are characterized in that they have at least one ketalized glycerol-containing radical.

EXAMPLES
Example 1: Ketalization of Glycerol Monoallyl Ether
In a 1 l multi-necked flask equipped with KPG stirrer, internal thermometer and reflux condenser, 300 g of glycerol monoallyl ether GAE (MW: 132.16 g/mol) together with 354.6 g of 2,2-dimethoxypropane DMP (MW: 104.15 g/mol; b.p.: 83° C.; 50% excess) are initially charged at 20° C. and then 0.33 g of p-toluenesulphonic acid p-TSA (0.05% based on GAE and DMP) added and the mixture heated at reflux temperature for one hour. The reflux condenser is then replaced by a distillation system. Over the course of 4 hours a slow reduction in distillate takes place, whereupon the distillate temperature increases up to 80° C. After cooling the bottom, 13 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate are added over the course of 30 minutes to neutralize the acid. The salt is removed by means of a pleated filter (MN 615 1/4) and the filtrate is freed from volatiles on a rotary evaporator at 60° C. and a pressure of <lmbar. The 1H-NMR spectrum of the colorless clear liquid demonstrates quantitative ketalization.
Example 2: Hydrosilylation of a Hydrogen Siloxane with 1-Dodecene and Glycerol Monoallyl Ether Ketal
In a 1 l multi-necked flask equipped with KPG stirrer, internal thermometer and reflux condenser, 96.6 g of the 28 val % glycerol monoallyl ether ketal prepared in Example 1; MW: 172.2 g/mol; 30% excess) together with 243.9 g of dodecene (72 val %; MW: 168.9 g/mol; 30% excess) are initially charged with stirring at 20° C. and heated to 60° C. The mixture of both components forms a clear phase. 237.2 mg of a Karstedt catalyst activated with ethylene dissolved in decamethylcyclopentasiloxane according to the teaching of EP 1520870 B1 (1% Pt dissolved in Ds, ethylene sparged corresponding to 3 ppm Pt based on the total mixture) are added and then 450 g of a hydrogen siloxane, which has both pendant and terminal SiH functions and an average chain length N=120 (SiH value: 3.43 mmol SiH/g) are added dropwise over 30 minutes. The exotherm which occurs heats the reaction mixture, which remains clear, over the whole period of the addition to 90° C. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 4 hours at 90° C.
The gas volumetric SiH determination (decomposition of a weighed sample aliquot in a gas burette by addition of sodium butoxide solution and measurement of the hydrogen volume released) shows a SiH conversion of 99.1%. The crude product is freed from volatiles on a rotary evaporator at 130° C. and at an applied vacuum of <1 mbar. A clear pale yellow liquid is isolated. A 1H-NMR spectrum confirms the desired structure.
Example 3: Deketalization/Partial Hydrolysis of the Precursor Prepared in Example 2
In a 250 ml multi-necked flask equipped with internal thermometer and reflux condenser, 5 g of a 5% aqueous toluenesulphonic acid solution are added with stirring to 100 g of the precursor prepared in Example 2 and the mixture is heated to 80° C. with further continuous stirring for 6 hours. After cooling the reaction mixture to 20° C., 5 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate are added to neutralize the acid. This mixture is allowed to react for ca. 30 minutes before the salt is removed with the aid of a filter press (Seitz K300 filter sheet) and the filtrate is freed of volatile constituents at 80° C. and an applied vacuum of <1 mbar.

RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/761,680, filed Jul. 17, 2015, now U.S. Pat. No. 10,221,283, which is a 35 U.S.C. § 371 filing of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2014/012000, filed Jan. 17, 2014, which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61/754,274, filed Jan. 18, 2013, and 61/904,549, filed Nov. 15, 2013, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND
Polysiloxanes have a myriad of uses in daily life, and many substituted polysiloxanes have allowed the list of uses to become even larger. Amino groups attached to the side chains of polysiloxane backbones offer an attractive platform from which subtle chemical changes can be made easily, leading to large changes in the bulk properties of the materials. Simple alterations of amino-substituted polysiloxanes have been exploited to produce new materials. For example, addition of an uncharged triatomic molecule, such as CO2 or CS2, can create ionic centers within the polymer matrixes that have a profound effect on the viscosity, adhesive, and swelling properties of a polysiloxane. Depending on the nature of the triatomic molecule added, the post-addition treatment, the percent of monomers in the polysiloxane with an amino functionality, and the type of amino group, the materials can be transformed from the free-flowing, slippery liquids to strong (reversible) adhesives and very viscous syrups, rubbery materials, or gels, some of which are able to imbibe selectively large amounts of low polarity solvents.
The effects of other simple additives which are capable of creating ion pairs within the polysiloxanes on the polymer properties remain a potential source of cost-effective and useful materials.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
An aspect of the present invention relates to polysiloxane materials containing a basic functional group (e.g., amine or other group capable of accepting a proton) combined with an acid to form materials with useful properties (e.g., as transparent films, adhesives, binding agents, conductors, membranes, or controlled-release systems). In certain embodiments, the acid is a mono-acid (e.g., acetic acid). In certain embodiments, the acid is a di-acid (e.g., succinic acid). In certain embodiments, the acid is a tri-acid. In certain embodiments, the acid contains an aromatic group.
An aspect of the present invention relates to polysiloxane materials containing an acidic functional group (e.g., carboxylic acid or other group capable of donating a proton) combined with a base to form materials with useful properties (e.g., as transparent films, adhesives, binding agents, conductors, membranes, or controlled-release systems). In certain embodiments, the base is mono-basic (e.g., butyl amine, di(isopropyl)amine, or triethylamine). In certain embodiments, the base is di-basic (e.g., ethylene diamine). In certain embodiments, the base is tri-basic. In certain embodiments, the base contains an aromatic group (e.g., aniline).
The changes in rheological, adhesive, and swelling properties that occur when a series of mono-carboxylic acids or di-carboxylic acids are added to 6-7PSil, a polysiloxane in which 6-7% of the side groups contain a primary amine functionality, give rise to materials useful as polymer networks for chemical or oil spill cleanup, drug delivery systems, transparent films, adhesives, binding agents, conductors, membranes, cross-linking agents, or opticoelectronic applications. Those changes are correlated with (especially) the structures of the acids. In addition, described herein are materials made from in situ photo-polymerization of unsaturated carboxylic acids that were added to the polysiloxane. The results demonstrate that drastic changes effected by such additions (or polymerizations) lead to materials with drastically different properties than those of the parent polysiloxane. Clearly, the materials may be useful in a variety of new applications, and the protocols described here can be applied directly to other amino-substituted polymers, including those which are not polysiloxanes.
Polysiloxane ammonium salts have wide-ranging utility primarily based on the unique character of silicon-containing polymers (e.g., stability, low water solubility) and their adaptability to various technical fields. Polysiloxanes exhibit low surface tension, high flexibility, excellent stability to heating, and resistance to oxidation and aging. However, the high malleability and relatively low viscosity of polysiloxane can be disadvantageous because they can't be made into fibers and immobilized films without significant structural modifications, such as crosslinking. Crosslinking systems have been designed consisting of the polysiloxane amine and CO2 or CS2. At the same time, it is widely known that amines form ammonium salts when combined with an acid. So polysiloxane ammonium salt could be easily produced with polysiloxane amine, but it would exhibit higher hydrophilicity than polysiloxane amine, which may lead to different aggregation, solubility, rheology or swelling properties.
In the present invention, ammoniumpolysiloxane networks with acids such as carboxylates are produced from aminopolysiloxane such as 6-7PSil or D2EDA (see structure in Scheme 1) and different mono-acids or di-acids. Ionic crosslinking could be realized through the salt formation reaction of the two carboxylic groups of a diacid compound, or even through electrostatic interactions when a monocarboxylic acid was employed.

The invention relates to a method for preparing polyorganosiloxanes functionalized by (meth)acrylate groups, preferably acrylate groups.
_____d:
The present invention relates to a process for preparing organopolysiloxanes functionalized with (meth)acrylate groups, preferably acrylate groups. For the whole of the document, it should be understood that (meth)acrylate groups comprise acrylate groups, methacrylate groups or a mixture of both.
These (meth)acrylate functionalities are present in hydrocarbon-based radicals bonded to the polysiloxane chain by an Si—C bond which may be present in the chain or at the chain end. These (meth)acrylic acid ester functions are capable of reacting, via the radical route, under actinic and/or heat activation according to a polyaddition polymerization mechanism.
These (meth)acrylate-f unction-comprising organopolysiloxanes are widely used in radically crosslinkable silicone compositions for producing an elastomer, which can optionally be thin-film-coated onto a flexible support which is made of textile, paper, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyester, polypropylene, polyamide, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane or nonwoven glass fibers.
The coating of silicone formulations onto flexible supports is intended for numerous applications. For example, when the flexible support is a textile, waterproofing properties are intended, or when the support is a paper or a polymer of PVC or PET type, non-stick properties are usually sought.
Non-stick coatings are useful for numerous applications where it is required to render a surface or a material non-stick with respect to other materials, to which said surface or material would normally stick. For example, silicone compositions are used as coatings for non-stick papers and can thus be combined with adhesive elements that can be easily released without losing their adhesive properties, these elements possibly being pressure-sensitive adhesives for labels, decorative laminates, transfer tape, etc. Silicone-based non-stick coatings applied on paper, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester and other supports of this type are also used as non-stick surfaces for products for food use and in particular in the industrial packaging sector.
There has consequently for a long time been a great deal of interest in these (meth)acrylate-function-comprising organopolysiloxanes and the preparation thereof can be envisioned in various ways described in the prior art.
It is known that (meth)acrylate-function-comprising organopolysiloxanes are obtained industrially by reaction between an organopolysiloxane functionalized with epoxy groups and (meth)acrylic acid in the presence of a chromium-based catalyst. The (meth)acrylic acid reacts with the epoxy group to form a (meth)acrylic acid monoester comprising a hydroxyl group in the vicinal position. This reaction is described in comparative example 2 of patent FR 2632960 wherein an organopolysiloxane with epoxy functions reacts with acrylic acid in the presence of chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate as catalyst, to obtain an organopolysiloxane with acrylate functions. No solvent is used for carrying out this reaction and a reaction time of 30 hours at 100° C. is described. When the teaching of this reference was reproduced, it was noted that the reaction medium was heterogeneous, no doubt because of the lack of solubility of the catalyst in the organopolysiloxanes. As long as the reaction medium is not stirred, a deposit forms, which is a major drawback for its industrial use since deposits in equipment can lead to blockages and complex systems for rinsing and cleaning reactors and pipes need to be implemented in order to manage this risk. Patent EP 1276825-B1 also teaches the preparation of acrylate-function-comprising organopolysiloxanes by reaction between an organopolysiloxane having epoxy functionalities and acrylic acid in the presence of chromium(III) acetate and of two solvents, one of which being an alcohol. Nevertheless, the yield and the selectivity of this process can be improved. Furthermore, the compositions comprising the acrylic-function-comprising organopolysiloxanes obtained according to the teaching of patent EP 1276825 have an unpleasant odor that is uncomfortable for users of these compositions.
In this context, one of the essential objectives of the present invention is to develop a process for preparing organopolysiloxanes functionalized with (meth)acrylate groups with an improved yield and an optimized reaction time, for example less than 10 hours, and not having any unpleasant odor.
Another essential objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing organopolysiloxanes functionalized with (meth)acrylate groups, which is easy to implement during industrial production, minimizing the risks of blocking up the equipment.
Another essential objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing organopolysiloxanes functionalized with (meth)acrylate groups, the industrial implementation of which is controlled by decreasing the concentration of catalyst.
Another essential objective of this invention is to provide a process for preparing organopolysiloxanes functionalized with (meth)acrylate groups, wherein the organopolysiloxane chain length is not modified, that is to say wherein there are no siloxane bond cleavage and redistribution reactions (chain shortening) nor any bridging (chain extending) reactions, for example by the side reaction between an epoxide and the hydroxyl function of the hydroxy acrylate or by the epoxide polymerization.
Another objective of this invention is to provide a process for producing a silicone coating on a substrate with good properties of attachment or adhesion to the substrate.
All these objectives, among others, are achieved by the present invention which relates to a process for preparing a composition X comprising at least one organopolysiloxane A comprising at least one (meth)acrylate group, said process comprising the following steps:
a) at least one organopolysiloxane B comprising at least one epoxy group is reacted, at a temperature of between 50 and 130° C., preferably between 70 and 130° C. and even more preferentially between 90 and 125° C., with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a mixture of the two, in the absence of alcohol and in the presence:
of a catalyst C which is a complex of chromium in the oxidation state (III),
of at least 4.5% by weight, relative to the total weight of the reaction medium of this step a), of a solvent S and
of at least one inhibitor of polymerization of acrylic acid or of methacrylic acid,
b) the reaction medium obtained at the end of step a) is devolatilized and
c) said composition X comprising at least one organopolysiloxane A is obtained.
Step a) of the process for preparing the composition X according to the invention is carried out in the absence of alcohol and in particular in the absence of butanol.
The term “solvent” is intended to mean a non-reactive solvent. Consequently, the solvent S is different than the organopolysiloxane B, than acrylic acid and than methacrylic acid.
According to another embodiment, the process for preparing the composition in X according to the invention is carried out in the absence of double-bond-free carboxylic acid. As double-bond-free carboxylic acid, mention may be made of alkyl carboxylic acids having from 2 to 11 carbon atoms. Examples of such monocarboxylic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, pivalic acid, 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid, 2,2-dimethylvaleric acid, acetoacetic acid, isooctanecarboxylic acid, isododecanecarboxylic acid, scorbic acid and undecanoic acid, and in particular acetic acid. Preferably, the process for preparing the composition X according to the invention is carried out in the absence of acetic acid.
The process for preparing the composition X according to the invention has the advantage of obtaining an improved organopolysiloxane A yield. The inventors, to their credit, have identified that the implementation of the process in the absence of alcoholic solvent makes it possible to obtain a better organopolysiloxane A yield. Furthermore, this process has the advantage of having, in step a), a homogeneous and clear reaction medium simplifying the industrial implementation of said process, limiting the risk of blocking of the equipment and, consequently, improving health and safety conditions. Moreover, the process according to the invention does not modify the chain length of the starting organopolysiloxane B, while at the same time having a yield and a duration compatible with an industrial production. Another advantage of the process according to the invention is that the composition X obtained does not have an unpleasant odor.
Another advantage of the process according to the invention is that, in step a) of the process, a degree of conversion of the epoxy groups of greater than 98% can be obtained in less than six hours. Those skilled in the art will know how to adjust the reaction time of step a) of the process according to the invention as a function of the temperature in order to obtain a sufficient degree of conversion.
According to one preferential embodiment of the invention, the duration of step a) is between one and five hours when the temperature of step a) is between 90 and 125° C.

It is thus possible to obtain an organopolysiloxane A comprising epoxy functions and (meth)acrylate functions which can be used for example as an adhesion modulator or as an adhesion promoter, or an organopolysiloxane A comprising only or essentially (meth)acrylate functions, which is used for example as an essential constituent of radically crosslinkable silicone compositions for producing an elastomer. The molar ratio R between the (meth)acrylic acid and the epoxy functions of the organopolysiloxane B used in the process will be adjusted accordingly.
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, in step a), the molar ratio R between the (meth)acrylic acid and the epoxy group(s) borne by the organopolysiloxane B is greater than 1 and preferably between 1.05 and 1.50, and even more preferentially between 1.05 and 1.20.
For the whole of the document, the (meth)acrylic acid comprises acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.
According to one preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, in step a), the molar ratio R between the acrylic acid and the epoxy group(s) borne by the organopolysiloxane B is greater than 1 and preferably between 1.05 and 1.50, and even more preferentially between 1.05 and 1.20.

Naphthenic acids are by-products of the extraction of bitumen oil sands and are found mainly in bitumen oil sand residues. Commercial mixtures of naphthenic acids are used as solvents, detergents and rubber recovering agents. They may be mixtures of monocyclic and/or bicyclic carboxylic acids.
According to one embodiment of the process, it is preferable for the ligands not to have too high a molecular weight. Consequently, according to one preferential embodiment, the carboxylate ligands have from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and even more preferentially from 1 to 12 carbon atoms.
According to one particularly advantageous embodiment, the catalyst C is a carboxylate of chromium in the oxidation state (III), chosen from the group consisting of chromium(III) acrylate, chromium(III) methacrylate, chromium(III) acetate, chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate, chromium(III) neodecanoate and mixtures thereof.
According to another embodiment of the process according to the invention, the chromium(III) carboxylate can be generated in situ.
According to one embodiment, the concentration of catalyst C, expressed as mol % relative to the epoxy groups of the organopolysiloxane B, is between 0.05% and 1%, preferably between 0.05% and 0.5%, more preferentially between 0.05% and 0.3% and even more preferentially between 0.05% and 0.25%.
Another advantage of the process according to the invention is that it is possible to use a small amount of catalyst.
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, in step a), the solvent S is chosen from the group consisting of methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and mixtures thereof.
Preferably, in the process according to the invention, there is no solvent other than the solvent S chosen from the group consisting of methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and mixtures thereof.
More preferentially, the solvent S is methyl isobutyl ketone.
Even more preferentially, in the process according to the invention, there is no solvent other than methyl isobutyl ketone.
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the content of solvent S used in step a) of the process as described above is between 4.5% and 20% by weight, preferably between 4.5% and 15% by weight, more preferentially between 5% and 15% by weight, and even more preferentially between 5% and 13% by weight, relative to the total weight of the reaction mixture used in step a) of the process.
If the amount of solvent S is less than 4.5% by weight relative to the total weight of the reaction medium used in step a) of the process according to the invention, the reaction medium of step a) is heterogeneous, which complicates its industrial use since risks of fouling and blocking of industrial pipes occur.
If the amount of solvent S is greater than 20% by weight relative to the total weight of the reaction medium used in step a) of the process according to the invention, the reaction time required to achieve a degree of conversion of the epoxy groups of greater than 98% could increase.
According to one preferential embodiment of the invention, in step a), the catalyst C, the inhibitor of (meth)acrylic acid polymerization, the solvent S and a part or all of the (meth)acrylic acid can be premixed before the addition of the organopolysiloxane B.
In the process according to the invention, in step a), an inhibitor of (meth)acrylic acid polymerization is introduced. Inhibitors of (meth)acrylic acid polymerization are widely known and, by way of example, mention may be made of phenolic compounds such as 4-methoxyphenol, hydroquinone and methyl hydroquinone, or alkyl diphenyl amines such as, for example, phenothiazine. Preferably, methyl ether of hydroquinone (MEHQ) or 4-methoxyphenol is used as inhibitor of (meth)acrylic acid polymerization. According to one preferential embodiment, the amount of polymerization inhibitor used is between 0.01% and 1% by weight relative to the organopolysiloxane B and even more preferentially between 0.01% and 0.5%.
In step b) of the process according to the invention, the reaction medium obtained at the end of step a) is devolatilized. For this, the reaction medium resulting from step a) is heated at a temperature of between 80 and 130° C. under reduced pressure. This devolatilization step makes it possible to evaporate off the solvent S and the excess (meth)acrylic acid.
The solvent S used in the process according to the invention can be recycled.
According to another embodiment, a filtration step can also be carried out before or after step b). Preferably, if a filtration step is added to the process according to the invention, it takes place after step b).
According to another embodiment of the invention, the process according to the invention consists of the following steps:
a) at least one organopolysiloxane B comprising at least one epoxy group is reacted, at a temperature of between 50 and 130° C., preferably between 70 and 130° C. and even more preferentially between 90 and 125° C., with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a mixture of the two, in the absence of alcohol and in the presence:
of a catalyst C which is a complex of chromium in the oxidation state (III),
of at least 4.5% by weight, relative to the total weight of the reaction medium of this step a), of a solvent S and
of at least one inhibitor of polymerization of acrylic acid or of methacrylic acid,
b) the reaction medium obtained at the end of step a) is devolatilized,
c) optionally, the reaction medium obtained at the end of step b) is filtered, and
d) said composition X comprising at least one organopolysiloxane A is obtained.
During the implementation of the process, it is possible but not necessary to carry out steps a) and b) under an inert atmosphere. According to one preferred embodiment, when a phenolic compound is used as (meth)acrylic acid inhibitor, steps a) and b) of the process will be carried out under air and even more preferentially under flushing with dry air.
Another subject of the invention relates to the composition X which can be obtained by means of the process described above.
A final subject of the invention relates to a process for producing a coating on a substrate, comprising the following steps:

b) a radically crosslinkable silicone composition W is prepared, comprising:
i. said composition X,
ii. a photoinitiator, and
iii. optionally at least one additive,
c) said composition W is applied to a substrate, and
d) said composition W is crosslinked by exposure to radiation.
Preferably, the substrate is a flexible textile, paper, polyvinyl chloride, polyester, polypropylene, polyamide, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyurethane or nonwoven glass fiber support.
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, in step d), the radiation is ultraviolet light with a wavelength of less than 400 nanometers.
The irradiation time can be short and it is generally less than 1 second and is of the order of a few hundredths of a second for small coating thicknesses. The crosslinking obtained is excellent even in the absence of any heating.
According to another embodiment, the crosslinking step d) is carried out at a temperature of between 40 and 100° C.
Of course, the curing time can in particular be adjusted, by means of the number of UV lamps used, the UV exposure time and the distance between the composition and the UV lamp.
The amount of composition W deposited on the substrate is variable and usually ranges between 0.1 and 5 g/m2 of surface area treated. This amount depends on the nature of the support and on the desired non-stick properties. It is usually between 0.5 and 1.5 g/m2.
This process is particularly suitable for preparing a non-stick silicone coating on a substrate which is a flexible textile, paper, polyvinyl chloride, polyester, polypropylene, polyamide, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyurethane or nonwoven glass fiber support.
These coatings are particularly suitable for use in the non-stick field.
For polymerizing organopolysiloxanes functionalized with (meth)acrylate groups, those skilled in the art will be able to choose a suitable radical photoinitiator which absorbs light radiation with a wavelength of less than 400 nm. As an example of radical photoinitiators, mention may be made of: a-hydroxy ketones, benzoin ethers and aromatic a-amino ketones. By way of examples of a radical photoinitiator, mention will in particular be made of the following products: isopropylthioxanthone; benzophenone; camphorquinone; 9-xanthenone; anthraquinone; 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone; 2-methylanthraquinone; 2,2′-bis(3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone); 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone; 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone; 1,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone; 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione; 5,7-dihydroxyflavone; dibenzoyl peroxide; 2-benzoylbenzoic acid; 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone; 2-phenylacetophenone; 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide; anthrone; bis(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)-2,4,4-trimethylpentylphosphine oxide; 4,4′-dimethoxybenzoin; phenanthrenequinone; 2-ethylanthraquinone; 2-methylanthraquinone; 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone; dibenzoyl peroxide; 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone; benzoin; 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone; benzaldehyde; 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl) ketone; benzoylacetone; ethyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phenylphosphinate; and mixtures thereof.
By way of examples of commercial products of radical photoinitiators, mention may be made of the products sold by the company Ciba-Geigy: Irgacure® 369, Irgacure® 651, Irgacure® 907, Darocure® 1173, etc.
The amount of photoinitiator in the composition W is generally between 0.001 and 5 parts by weight, usually between 0.005 and 3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the composition W.
The additives may include at least one additive for regulating the detachment force of a silicone/adhesive interface in the composition, which is chosen from:
(i) organic (meth)acrylate derivatives, and
(ii) methacrylate-function(s)-comprising silicons.
Suitable in particular as organic (meth)acrylate derivatives are epoxidized (meth)acrylate, (meth)acryloglyceropolyester, (meth)acrylourethane, (meth)acrylopolyether, (meth)acrylopolyester and (meth)acryloacrylic compounds. Particularly preferred are trimethylolpropane triacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate and pentaerythrityl tetraacrylate.
According to one preferred variant of the invention, the additive used is a (meth)acrylate-function(s)-comprising silicone. By way of representation of (meth)acrylate functions borne by the silicone and most particularly suitable for the invention, mention may more particularly be made of derivatives of acrylates, methacrylates, (meth)acrylate ethers and meth(acrylate) esters bonded to the polysiloxane chain by an Si—C bond. Such acrylate derivatives are in particular described in patents EP 281 718, FR 2 632 960 and EP 940 458.
Other additives, such as thiols or aromatic amines, can be added in order to accelerate the crosslinking of the composition W.
A final subject of the invention relates to a substrate comprising at least one coating which can be obtained according to the process as described above.
The present invention is illustrated below by nonlimiting examples.
EXAMPLES
1-Preparation of the Compositions Comprising Organopolysiloxanes Comprising Acrylate Groups
The following are charged, with stirring, to a 250 ml reactor equipped with magnetic-bar stirring, a reflux condenser, an air inlet and a thermometric sheath:
130 g of a polydimethylsiloxane oil H functionalized with epoxy groups with a dynamic viscosity at 25° C. of approximately 60 mPa·s. This oil contains hydrocarbon-based groups Y comprising an epoxy group of formula (R-4) below:
The molar content of epoxy in the oil H is 232 mmol per 100 g, which corresponds to an amount of epoxy groups per molecule of between 2 and 15;
25 g of acrylic acid,
0.086 g of chromium(III) acetate,
0.039 g of methyl ether of hydroquinone (MEHQ), and
variable amounts of solvent (see table 1).
The stirring is adjusted to 700 rpm, then the reactor is heated at 115° C. with an aluminum hotplate while an air flow of approximately 130 ml/h is maintained. Samples are taken over time in order to measure the degree of conversion (or of transformation) of the epoxy groups by potentiometry. After 3 h 30 of reaction, the mixture is devolatilized under vacuum (gradually up to 1 mbar) while at the same time maintaining bubbling of air in order to evaporate off the acrylic acid which has not been consumed and the reaction solvents. After cooling, the composition obtained is filtered under pressure on a cellulose filter. The acrylate functions are quantitatively determined by 1H NMR.
The acrylation yield is calculated as the ratio between the number of moles of acrylate quantitatively determined in the composition and the number of moles of epoxy initially introduced, multiplied by 100.
The acrylation selectivity is equal to the acrylation yield over the degree of conversion of the epoxy groups. The desired objective is to obtain the highest possible selectivity.
The results are presented in table 1 below.

These tests shows that the process according to the invention makes it possible to obtain a good yield and a good acrylation selectivity with a homogeneous and clear reaction medium in step a) of the process. The composition obtained after devolatilization is also homogeneous and does not have any unpleasant odor.
For comparative test 1 in the presence of two solvents (MIBK and n-butanol), the reaction medium is homogeneous and clear, but the acrylation selectivity is less than 95% and the acrylation yield is only 93%. Furthermore, the composition obtained has an unpleasant odor.
For comparative tests 2, 3 and 4, the reaction medium is cloudy and heterogeneous, which is not desirable for an industrial implementation.

In order to characterize the compositions obtained during each test, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was measured by a GPC analysis. It is noted that the compositions obtained during comparative tests 2 and 4 have the highest viscosity and average molecular weight, which may be an indicator of a greater presence of traces of coupling products resulting from the side reaction between an epoxy group and the hydroxyl function of the hydroxyacrylate.
The tests according to the invention make it possible to obtain the desired compromise, that is to say a process in which the reaction medium is homogeneous and clear, which makes it possible to obtain very good acrylation yields and selectivities while at the same time controlling the coupling side reactions.
2-Tests for Preparation of a Non-Stick Coating on a Flexible Support
30 g of the compositions comprising acrylate-f unction-comprising polyorganosiloxanes obtained according to the tests above (see tables 1 and 2) and 2 g of a radical photoinitiator which is ethyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phenylphosphinate are added to 70 g of a polydimethylsiloxane oil with acrylate units, sold under the trade name Silcolease® UV Poly 110 (viscosity 880 mPA·s and 5.7% by weight of acrylate group).
Each of these formulations is coated onto an LDPE GLD2 film from the company Granger, with an amount of deposit of between 0.9 and 1.1 g/m2. The samples of coated film are crosslinked with a UV lamp which has a power of 100 W/cm. The traveling speed of the coated samples under the UV lamp is 200 m/min.
The quality of the polymerization and the attachment of the coating were evaluated by means of various trade tests.
The “Rub-Off” measurement used to verify the adhesion to the support and the abrasion resistance of the silicone layer consists in rubbing the index finger on the siliconized support in order to apply mechanical stresses to the layer. The number of back and forward movements with the finger until the appearance of the rub-off (or scrubbing) phenomenon, corresponding to the silicone coating being torn into shreds, is scored. The score of 1 indicates poor abrasion resistance of the silicone layer and the score of 10 indicates excellent abrasion resistance of the silicone layer. This application test is scored from 1, the poorest, to 10, the best result.
The samples according to the invention have excellent attachment performances which are much better than comparative 1.

_____d:
The present disclosure generally relates to 2 part silicone compositions which cure via a condensation cure chemistry using titanium and/or zirconium based catalysts to generate elastomeric or gel end products and the applications for same.
In many instances silicone based materials such as elastomers or gels used as coating, potting, and encapsulating materials must maintain adhesion to substrates and/or other materials. In electronics for example, gels are a special class of encapsulants that cure to form an extremely soft material. They are used to provide high levels of stress relief to sensitive circuitry. Both gels and elastomers perform many important functions in electronics. Their major job is to protect electronic assemblies and components from adverse environments by:
functioning as dielectric insulation,
protecting the circuit from moisture and other contaminants and
relieving mechanical and thermal stress on components.
In such situations the gels are required to adhere to electronic and electrical components and printed circuit boards in addition to the electrical connectors and conductors that pass through the coating or encapsulating material.
The commercial silicone materials that are currently used to form the encapsulants and pottants etc. (e.g. gels) are expensive being based on addition cure chemistry, i.e. they are cured by the reaction of a silicon hydride group with an unsaturated carbon radical with the help of a catalyst, which is typically a platinum based compound. Historically the industry has preferred addition cure compositions of this type for these applications because they immediately cure throughout the body of the compound resulting in a cured material in a matter of minutes whilst condensation cure systems are significantly slower, titanate cured condensation processes can take e.g. up to 7 days curing per 6 mm of depth of the body of the uncured material. Tin cured condensation systems do cure over a shorter period but they are not desired for e.g. electronics applications because they undergo reversion (i.e. depolymerisation) at temperatures above 80° C.
Whilst from a cure speed standpoint materials made from hydrosilylation cure compositions are excellent there are several potential problems and/or disadvantages with their use. For example, they are generally cured at elevated temperature (i.e. in excess of 100° C.) and can be contaminated and rendered uncurable due to inactivation of expensive platinum based cure catalysts which are sensitive and may be poisoned by amine containing compounds, sulphur containing compounds and phosphorus containing compounds.
It is well known to people skilled in the art that alkoxy titanium compounds—i.e. alkyl titanates—are suitable catalysts for formulating one component moisture curable silicones (References: Noll, W.; Chemistry and Technology of Silicones, Academic Press Inc., New York, 1968, p. 399, Michael A. Brook, silicon in organic, organometallic and polymer chemistry, John Wiley & sons, Inc. (2000), p. 285). Titanate catalysts have been widely described for their use to formulate skin or diffusion cured one-part condensation curing silicone elastomers. These formulations are typically available in one-part packages that are applied in a layer that is thinner than typically 15 mm. Layers thicker than 15 mm are known to lead to uncured material in the depth of the material, because the moisture is very slow to diffuse in very deep sections. Skin or diffusion cure (e.g. moisture/condensation) takes place when the initial cure process takes place by the formation of a cured skin at the composition/air interface subsequent to the sealant/encapsulant being applied on to a substrate surface. Subsequent to the generation of the surface skin the cure speed is dependent on the speed of diffusion of moisture from the sealant/encapsulant interface with air to the inside (or core), and the diffusion of condensation reaction by-product/effluent from the inside (or core) to the outside (or surface) of the material and the gradual thickening of the cured skin over time from the outside/surface to the inside/core.
Multi component compositions designed to activate condensation cure in the bulk of the product do not use titanium based catalysts. They generally use other metal catalysts such as tin or zinc catalyst, e.g. dibutyl tin dilaurate, tin octoate and/or zinc octoate (Noll, W.; Chemistry and Technology of Silicones, Academic Press Inc., New York, 1968, p. 397). In silicone compositions stored before use in two or more parts, one-part contains a filler which typically contains the moisture required to activate condensation cure in the bulk of the product. Unlike the previously mentioned diffusion cure one-part system, two-part condensation cure systems, once mixed together, enable bulk cure even in sections greater than 15 mm in depth. In this case the composition will cure (subsequent to mixing) throughout the material bulk. If a skin is formed, it will be only in the first minutes after application. Soon after, the product will become a solid in the entire mass. Titanate catalysts are not used for curing these types of two part compositions because it is well known that in the presence of a significant amount of moisture alkyl titanate catalysts will fully hydrolyse to form tetrahydroxy titanate, which is insoluble in silicone. This form of titanium loses its catalytic efficiency, leading to uncured systems. Patent publications are known to disclose two-part condensation cure silicones with examples of such curing systems. Typically, the examples disclosed identify alkyl tin catalysts as suitable for these formulations, examples of such publications include WO2007117551 A1, WO2007117552 A1, WO2013100175 A1 and WO2015091396 A1. It is significant to note that no examples in these publications or so far as we are aware in similar systems have been published with alkyl titanates as catalysts. The main reason for that is that formulations used with tin as catalyst will not cure properly if the tin catalyst is replaced by an alkyl titanate. Despite this each of the patent publications identified above list alkyl titanates despite their unsuitability for the purpose.
It is well known to people skilled in the art that titanate catalyst will not efficiently catalyse the bulk cure of such formulations due to the above mentioned inactivation. Herein, two-part condensation cure silicone formulations are disclosed, which surprisingly can be cured with the use of alkyl titanates providing boundary conditions for such formulations are followed for the cure process.
There is provided an elastomeric or gel material which is the condensation reaction product of a multiple part composition comprising:
(i) at least one condensation curable silyl terminated polymer having at least one, typically at least 2 hydroxyl functional groups per molecule;
(ii) a cross-linker selected from the group of
silanes having at least 2 hydrolysable groups, alternatively at least 3 hydrolysable groups per molecule group; and/or
silyl functional molecules having at least 2 silyl groups, each silyl group containing at least one hydrolysable group
(iii) one or more hydrous fillers; and
(iv) a condensation catalyst selected from the group of titanates, zirconates; wherein polymer (i), cross-linker (ii) and catalyst (iv) are not stored together in the same part; and characterised in that the catalyst is present in a molar amount which is at least 50% of the moisture present cumulatively in the parts of the composition as determined in accordance with ISO 787-2:1981.
There is also provided a multiple part condensation curable elastomer or gel composition based on titanate/zirconate cure catalysts comprising
(i) at least one condensation curable silyl terminated polymer having at least one, typically at least 2 hydrolysable and/or hydroxyl functional groups per molecule;
(ii) a cross-linker selected from the group of
silanes having at least 2 hydrolysable groups, alternatively at least 3 hydrolysable groups per molecule group; and/or silyl functional molecules having at least 2 silyl groups, each silyl group containing at least one hydrolysable group (iii) one or more hydrous fillers;
(iii) one or more hydrous fillers; and
(iv) a condensation catalyst selected from the group of titanates, zirconates; wherein polymer (i), cross-linker (ii) and catalyst (iv) are not all stored together in the same part; and characterised in that the catalyst is present in a molar amount which is at least 50% of the moisture present cumulatively in the parts of the composition as determined in accordance with ISO 787-2:1981.
Typically the hydrous filler (iii) and catalyst (iv) will be stored in different parts.
In one embodiment the composition has the added requirement that the molar ratio of the excess of catalyst M-OR functions to the total of silicon bonded hydroxyl groups is comprised between 0.01:1 and 0.5:1, where M is titanium or zirconium.
The total silicon bonded hydroxyl (Si—OH) molar content is calculated for 100 g of the mixed formulation. The silicon bonded hydroxyl molar content related to a polymer is equal to the amount in g of hydroxyl containing polymer in 100 g of the mixed product divided by the number average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymer multiply by the average number of hydroxyl functions present in the polymer, typically 2. If there are several hydroxyl functional polymers in the formulation, the sum of the molar content of each polymer is sum up to constitute the total silanol molar content in the formulation.
The total hydrolysable groups molar content is calculated for 100 g of the mixed formulation. The molar content of hydrolysable groups related to a substance is equal to the amount in g of the molecule that contains the hydrolysable groups in 100 g of the mixed product divided by the molecular weight of the molecule or the number average molecular weight (Mn) in case it is a polymeric molecule multiply by the average number of hydrolysable functions present in the molecule. The sum of the molar content of each molecule or polymer is sum up to constitute the total molar content of hydrolysable groups in the formulation.
The molar ratio of silicon bonded hydroxyl groups in polymer (i) to hydrolysable groups from cross-linker (ii) is then calculated by dividing the total molar content of silicon bonded hydroxyl (Si—OH) groups in polymer (i) by the total molar content of hydrolysable groups from cross-linker (ii) or may be depicted as a ratio.
The number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) of silicone can also be determined by Gel permeation chromatography (GPC). This technique is a standard technique, and yields values for Mw (weight average), Mn (number average) and polydispersity index (PI) (where PI=Mw/Mn).
Mn value provided in this application have been determined by GPC and represent a typical value of the polymer used. If not provided by GPC, the Mn may also be obtained from calculation based on the dynamic viscosity of said polymer.
The catalyst M-OR value is =[(g of Titanate catalyst)*(number of OR in compound)] divided by the (molecular weight of Titanium catalyst).
The main advantages of these compositions are that they cure at room temperature, to form elastomers or gels with the catalyst utilised (condensation) being more resistant to contaminants than platinum cure silicones and provide, unlike tin catalysed compositions, a resistance to reversion when subjected to high temperature and high humidity. It has been identified that cure of these compositions is much faster than typical titanate or zirconate catalysed condensation reactions would anticipate, i.e. can be lower than 1 hour as opposed to days for standard 1 part titanate cured materials. Furthermore, a two part titanate formulation as hereinbefore described using fumed silica and containing adhesion promoter has unexpectedly been seen to develop adhesion on glass and anodized aluminium after less than 1 day.
Polymer (i) is at least one moisture/condensation curable silyl terminated polymer. Any suitable moisture/condensation curable silyl terminated polymer may be utilised including polydialkyl siloxanes, alkylphenyl siloxane, or organic based polymers with silyl terminal groups e.g. silyl polyethers, silyl acrylates and silyl terminated polyisobutylenes or copolymers of any of the above. Preferably the polymer is a polysiloxane based polymer containing at least two hydroxyl or hydrolysable groups, most preferably the polymer comprises terminal hydroxyl or hydrolysable groups. Examples of suitable hydroxyl groups include —Si(OH)3, —(Ra)Si(OH)2, —(Ra)2Si(OH), or —(Ra)2Si—Rc— SiRdp(OH)3-p where each Ra independently represents a monovalent hydrocarbyl group, for example, an alkyl group, in particular having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, (and is preferably methyl); each Rd group is independently an alkyl or alkoxy group in which the alkyl groups suitably have up to 6 carbon atoms; Rc is a divalent hydrocarbon group which may be interrupted by one or more siloxane spacers having up to six silicon atoms; and p has the value 0, 1 or 2.
Preferably polymer (i) has the general formula:
X3-A-X1  (1)
where X3 and X1 are independently selected from siloxane groups which terminate in hydroxyl or hydrolysable groups and A is a siloxane and/or organic containing polymeric chain, alternatively a siloxane polymeric chain.
Examples of hydroxyl-terminating or hydrolysable groups X3 or X1 include —Si(OH)3, —(Ra)Si(OH)2, —(Ra)2Si(OH), or —(Ra)2Si—Rc— Si (Rd)p(OH)3-p as defined above. Preferably the X3 and/or X′ terminal groups are hydroxydialkyl silyl groups, e.g. hydroxydimethyl silyl groups or alkoxydialkyl silyl groups e.g. methoxydimethyl silyl or ethoxydimethyl silyl.
Examples of suitable siloxane groups in polymeric chain A of formula (I) are those which comprise a polydiorgano-siloxane chain. Thus polymeric chain A preferably includes siloxane units of formula (2)
—(R5sSiO(4-s)2)—  (2)
in which each R5 is independently an organic group such as a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms optionally substituted with one or more halogen group such as chlorine or fluorine and s is 0, 1 or 2. Particular examples of groups R5 include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, vinyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, tolyl group, a propyl group substituted with chlorine or fluorine such as 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, chlorophenyl, beta-(perfluorobutyl)ethyl or chlorocyclohexyl group. Suitably, at least some and preferably substantially all of the groups R5 are methyl.
Typically the polymers of the above type will have a viscosity in the order of 1000 to 300 000 mPa·s, alternatively 1000 to 100 000 mPa·s at 23° C. measured by using a Brookfield cone plate viscometer (RV DIII) using the most suitable cone plate for the viscosity concerned.
The polymer (i) may alternatively be an organic based polymer having silyl terminal groups, each bearing at least one hydrolysable group. Typical silyl terminated polymers groups include silyl terminated polyethers, silyl terminated acrylates and silyl terminated polyisobutylenes. The silyl groups utilised will be one or more alternatives described above as X1 and X3 as discussed above.
Preferred polysiloxanes containing units of formula (2) are thus polydiorganosiloxanes having terminal, silicon-bound hydroxyl groups or terminal, silicon-bound organic radicals which can be hydrolysed using moisture as defined above. The polydiorganosiloxanes may be homopolymers or copolymers. Mixtures of different polydiorganosiloxanes having terminal condensable groups are also suitable.
In accordance with the present invention polymeric chain A may alternatively be organic based polymers with silyl terminal groups e.g. silyl polyethers, silyl acrylates and silyl terminated polyisobutylenes. In the case of silyl polyethers the polymer chain is based on polyoxyalkylene based units. Such polyoxyalkylene units preferably comprise a linear predominantly oxyalkylene polymer comprised of recurring oxyalkylene units, (—CnH2n—O—) illustrated by the average formula (—CnH2n—O—)y wherein n is an integer from 2 to 4 inclusive and y is an integer of at least four. The average molecular weight of each polyoxyalkylene polymer block may range from about 300 g/mol to about 10,000 g/mol, but can be higher in molecular weight. Moreover, the oxyalkylene units are not necessarily identical throughout the polyoxyalkylene monomer, but can differ from unit to unit. A polyoxyalkylene block or polymer, for example, can be comprised of oxyethylene units, (—C2H4—O—); oxypropylene units (—C3H6—O—); or oxybutylene units, (—C4H8—O—); or mixtures thereof.
Other polyoxyalkylene units may include for example: units of the structure
-[—Re—O—(˜Rf—O—)w-Pn-CRg2-Pn—O—(˜Rf—O—)q—Re]—
in which Pn is a 1,4-phenylene group, each Re is the same or different and is a divalent hydrocarbon group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, each Rf is the same or different and, is, an ethylene group or propylene group, each RG is the same or different and is, a hydrogen atom or methyl group and each of the subscripts w and q is a positive integer in the range from 3 to 30.
For the purpose of this application “Substituted” means one or more hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon group has been replaced with another substituent. Examples of such substituents include, but are not limited to, halogen atoms such as chlorine, fluorine, bromine, and iodine; halogen atom containing groups such as chloromethyl, perfluorobutyl, trifluoroethyl, and nonafluorohexyl; oxygen atoms; oxygen atom containing groups such as (meth)acrylic and carboxyl; nitrogen atoms; nitrogen atom containing groups such as amino-functional groups, amido-functional groups, and cyano-functional groups; sulphur atoms; and sulphur atom containing groups such as mercapto groups.
Crosslinkers (ii) that can be used are generally moisture curing
silanes having at least 2 hydrolysable groups, alternatively at least 3 hydrolysable groups per molecule group; and/or
silyl functional molecules having at least 2 silyl groups, each silyl group containing at least one hydrolysable group.
In some instances, the crosslinker (ii) having two hydrolysable groups may be considered a chain extender, i.e. when polymer (i) only has 1 or two reactive groups, but can be used to cross-link if polymer (i) has 3 or more reactive groups per molecule. The crosslinker (ii) may thus have two but alternatively has three or four silicon-bonded condensable (preferably hydroxyl and/or hydrolysable) groups per molecule which are reactive with the condensable groups in polymer (i).
For the sake of the disclosure herein a silyl functional molecule is a silyl functional molecule containing two or more silyl groups, each silyl group containing at least one hydrolysable group. Hence, a disilyl functional molecule comprises two silicon atoms each having at least one hydrolysable group, where the silicon atoms are separated by an organic or siloxane spacer. Typically, the silyl groups on the disilyl functional molecule may be terminal groups. The spacer may be a polymeric chain.
For the sake of the disclosure herein a disilane is a silyl functional molecule having at least 2 silyl groups where the two silicon atoms are bonded to one another.
The hydrolysable groups on the silyl groups include acyloxy groups (for example, acetoxy, octanoyloxy, and benzoyloxy groups); ketoximino groups (for example dimethyl ketoximo, and isobutylketoximino); alkoxy groups (for example methoxy, ethoxy, and propoxy) and alkenyloxy groups (for example isopropenyloxy and 1-ethyl-2-methylvinyloxy). In some instances, the hydrolysable group may include hydroxyl groups.
The silane cross-linker (ii) may include alkoxy functional silanes, oximosilanes, acetoxy silanes, acetonoxime silanes and/or enoxy silanes.
When the crosslinker is a silane and when the silane has only three silicon-bonded hydrolysable groups per molecule, the fourth group is suitably a non-hydrolysable silicon-bonded organic group. These silicon-bonded organic groups are suitably hydrocarbyl groups which are optionally substituted by halogen such as fluorine and chlorine. Examples of such fourth groups include alkyl groups (for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl); cycloalkyl groups (for example cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl); alkenyl groups (for example vinyl and allyl); aryl groups (for example phenyl, and tolyl); aralkyl groups (for example 2-phenylethyl) and groups obtained by replacing all or part of the hydrogen in the preceding organic groups with halogen. The fourth silicon-bonded organic groups may be methyl.
A typical silane may be described by formula (3)
R″4-rSi(OR5)r  (3)
wherein R5 is described above and r has a value of 2, 3 or 4. Typical silanes are those wherein R″ represents methyl, ethyl or vinyl or isobutyl. R″ is an organic radical selected from linear and branched alkyls, allyls, phenyl and substituted phenyls, acethoxy, oxime. In some instances, R5 represents methyl or ethyl and r is 3.
Another type of suitable crosslinkers (ii) are molecules of the type Si(OR5)4 where R5 is as described above, alternatively propyl, ethyl or methyl. Partials condensates of Si(OR5)4 may also be considered.
In one embodiment the cross-linker (ii) is a silyl functional molecule having at least 2 silyl groups each having at least 1 and up to 3 hydrolysable groups, alternatively each silyl group has at least 2 hydrolysable groups.
The crosslinker (ii) may be a disilyl functional polymer, that is, a polymer containing two silyl groups, each containing at least one hydrolysable group such as described by the formula (4)
(R4O)m(Y1)3-m—Si(CH2)x—((NHCH2CH2)t-Q(CH2)x)n—Si(OR4)m(Y1)3-m  (4)
where R4 is a C1-10 alkyl group, Y1 is an alkyl groups containing from 1 to 8 carbons, Q is a chemical group containing a heteroatom with a lone pair of electrons e.g. an amine, N-alkylamine, or urea; each x is an integer of from 1 to 6, t is 0 or 1; each m is independently 1, 2 or 3 and n is 0 or 1.
The silyl (e.g. disilyl) functional crosslinker (ii) may have a siloxane or organic polymeric backbone. Suitable polymeric crosslinkers (ii) may have a similar polymeric backbone chemical structure to polymeric chain A as depicted in formula (1) above. In the case of such siloxane or organic based cross-linkers the molecular structure can be straight chained, branched, cyclic or macromolecular, i.e. a silicone or organic polymer chain bearing alkoxy functional end groups include polydimethylsiloxanes having at least one trialkoxy terminal where the alkoxy group may be a methoxy or ethoxy group.
In the case of siloxane based polymers the viscosity of the cross-linker will be within the range of from 0.5 mPa·s to 80,000 mPa·s at 23° C. using a Brookfield cone plate viscometer (RV DIII) utilising a cone plate (measured in the same manner as polymer (i)). Whilst any of the hydrolysable groups mentioned above are suitable it is preferred that the hydrolysable groups are alkoxy groups and as such the terminal silyl groups may have the formula such as —RaSi(ORb)2, —Si(ORb)3, —Ra2SiORb or —(Ra)2Si—R° — SiRdp(ORb)3-p where each Ra independently represents a monovalent hydrocarbyl group, for example, an alkyl group, in particular having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, (and is preferably methyl); each Rb and Rd group is independently an alkyl group having up to 6 carbon atoms; Rc is a divalent hydrocarbon group which may be interrupted by one or more siloxane spacers having up to six silicon atoms; and p has the value 0, 1 or 2. Typically each terminal silyl group will have 2 or 3 alkoxy groups.
Crosslinkers (ii) thus include alkyltrialkoxysilanes such as methyltrimethoxysilane (MTM) and methyltriethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, partially condensed tetraethoxysilane, alkenyltrialkoxy silanes such as vinyltrimethoxysilane and vinyltriethoxysilane, isobutyltrimethoxysilane (iBTM).

The cross-linker (ii) used may also comprise any combination of two or more of the above.
The one or more hydrous fillers (iii) may be one or more reinforcing fillers and or one or more non-reinforcing fillers or a mixture thereof. For the sake of this application the term hydrous means that the filler(s) have a moisture (i.e. water) content of >0.05% by weight as determined in accordance with ISO 787-2:1981 For the avoidance of doubt use of the term moisture is intended to mean water and does not include Si-alkoxy groups or Si bonded hydroxyl groups in both case discussed elsewhere.
Examples of finely divided, hydrous reinforcing fillers include high surface area fumed and precipitated silicas including rice hull ash and to a degree calcium carbonate. Examples of or additional finely divided hydrous non-reinforcing fillers include as crushed quartz, diatomaceous earths, barium sulphate, iron oxide, titanium dioxide and carbon black, talc, wollastonite. Other hydrous fillers which might be used alone or in addition to the above include carbon nanotubes, e.g. multiwall carbon nanotubes aluminite, hollow glass spheres, calcium sulphate (anhydrite), gypsum, calcium sulphate, magnesium carbonate, clays such as kaolin, aluminium trihydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (brucite), graphite, copper carbonate, e.g. malachite, nickel carbonate, e.g. zarachite, barium carbonate, e.g. witherite and/or strontium carbonate e.g. strontianite.
Further alternative fillers include aluminium oxide, silicates from the group consisting of olivine group; garnet group; aluminosilicates; ring silicates; chain silicates; and sheet silicates. The olivine group comprises silicate minerals, such as but not limited to, forsterite and Mg2SiO4. The garnet group comprises ground silicate minerals, such as but not limited to, pyrope; Mg3Al2Si3O12; grossular; and Ca2Al2Si3O12. Aluninosilicates comprise ground silicate minerals, such as but not limited to, sillimanite; Al2SiO5; mullite; 3Al2O3.2SiO2; kyanite; and Al2SiO5.
The ring silicates group comprises silicate minerals, such as but not limited to, cordierite and Al3(Mg,Fe)2[Si4AlO18]. The chain silicates group comprises ground silicate minerals, such as but not limited to, wollastonite and Ca[SiO3].
The sheet silicates group comprises silicate minerals, such as but not limited to, mica; K2Al14[Si6Al2O20](OH)4; pyrophyllite; Al4[Si8O20](OH)4; talc; Mg6[Si8O20](OH)4; serpentine for example, asbestos; Kaolinite; Al4[Si4O10](OH)8; and vermiculite.
The thermally conductive filler and/or the anhydrous reinforcing and/or extending filler if present, may optionally be surface treated with a treating agent. Treating agents and treating methods are known in the art, The surface treatment of the filler(s) is typically performed, for example with a fatty acid or a fatty acid ester such as a stearate, or with organosilanes, organosiloxanes, or organosilazanes such as hexaalkyl disilazane or short chain siloxane diols. Generally the surface treatment renders the filler(s) hydrophobic and therefore easier to handle and obtain a homogeneous mixture with the other components in the composition. Silanes such as
R5eSi(OR6)4-e
wherein R5 is a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group of 6 to 20 carbon atoms, for example, alkyl groups such as hexyl, octyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, and octadecyl, and aralkyl groups such as benzyl and phenylethyl, with the alkyl groups of 6 to 20 carbon atoms being preferred. R6 is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and letter e is equal to 1, 2 or 3 may also be utilised as the treating agent for fillers.
The composition further comprises a condensation catalyst (iv) which increases the speed at which the composition cures. The catalyst chosen for inclusion in a particular silicone sealant composition depends upon the speed of cure required. Titanate and/or zirconate based catalysts may comprise a compound according to the general formula Ti[OR22]4Zr[OR22]4 where each R22 may be the same or different and represents a monovalent, primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Optionally the titanate may contain partially unsaturated groups. However, preferred examples of R22 include but are not restricted to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tertiary butyl and a branched secondary alkyl group such as 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl. Preferably, when each R22 is the same, R22 is an isopropyl, branched secondary alkyl group or a tertiary alkyl group, in particular, tertiary butyl. Suitable examples include for the sake of example, tetra n-butyl titanate, tetra t-butyl titanate, tetra t-butoxy titanate, tetraisopropoxy titanate and diisopropoxydiethylacetoacetate titanate. Alternatively, the titanate may be chelated. The chelation may be with any suitable chelating agent such as an alkyl acetylacetonate such as methyl or ethylacetylacetonate. Alternatively, the titanate may be monoalkoxy titanates bearing three chelating agents such as for example 2-propanolato, tris isooctadecanoato titanate. The catalyst is present in a molar amount which is at least 50% of the molar amount of moisture (i.e. water) present cumulatively in Part A and Part B of the composition as determined in accordance with ISO 787-2:1981. Typically the vast majority of the moisture will originate from the hydrous fillers
Optional Ingredients

R14 can be an epoxy functional group such as glycidoxypropyl or (epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl, an amino functional group such as aminoethylaminopropyl or aminopropyl, a methacryloxypropyl, a mercapto functional group such as mercaptopropyl or an unsaturated organic group. Each R15 is independently an unsubstituted, saturated hydrocarbon group of at least 1 carbon atom. R15 may have 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alternatively 1 to 2 carbon atoms. R15 is exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and iso-propyl.
Examples of suitable adhesion promoters include glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and a combination of glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane with an aluminium chelate or zirconium chelate. Examples of adhesion promoters for hydrosilylation curable compositions may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,087,585 and 5,194,649. The curable composition may comprise, when present, 0.01% to 2 wt. %, alternatively 0.05 to 2 wt. %, alternatively 0.1 to 1 wt. % of adhesion promoter based on the weight of the composition. Preferably, the speed of hydrolysis of the adhesion promoter should be lower than the speed of hydrolysis of the cross-linker in order to favour diffusion of the molecule towards the substrate rather than its incorporation in the product network.
Additional Fillers
Thermally and/or electrically conductive fillers e.g. metallic fillers, and anhydrous meltable fillers, or a combination thereof. Metallic may be utilised. Such fillers include particles of metals and particles of metals having layers on the surfaces of the particles. These layers may be, for example, metal nitride layers or metal oxide layers on the surfaces of the particles. Suitable metallic fillers are exemplified by particles of metals selected from the group consisting of aluminium, copper, gold, nickel, tin, silver, and combinations thereof, and alternatively aluminium. Suitable metallic fillers are further exemplified by particles of the metals listed above having layers on their surfaces selected from the group consisting of aluminium nitride, aluminium oxide, copper oxide, nickel oxide, silver oxide, and combinations thereof. For example, the metallic filler may comprise aluminium particles having aluminium oxide layers on their surfaces.
Meltable fillers may comprise Bi, Ga, In, Sn, or an alloy thereof. The meltable filler may optionally further comprise Ag, Au, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, Zn, or a combination thereof. Examples of suitable meltable fillers include Ga, In—Bi—Sn alloys, Sn—In—Zn alloys, Sn—In—Ag alloys, Sn—Ag—Bi alloys, Sn—Bi—Cu—Ag alloys, Sn—Ag—Cu—Sb alloys, Sn—Ag—Cu alloys, Sn—Ag alloys, Sn—Ag—Cu—Zn alloys, and combinations thereof. The meltable filler may have a melting point ranging from 50° C. to 250° C., alternatively 150° C. to 225° C. The meltable filler may be a eutectic alloy, a non-eutectic alloy, or a pure metal. Meltable fillers are commercially available.
The thermally conductive filler may be a single thermally conductive filler or a combination of two or more thermally conductive fillers that differ in at least one property such as particle shape, average particle size, particle size distribution, and type of filler. In some embodiments, combinations of metallic and inorganic fillers, such as a combination of aluminium and aluminium oxide fillers; a combination of aluminium and zinc oxide fillers; or a combination of aluminium, aluminium oxide, and zinc oxide fillers may be used. In other embodiments, it may be desirable to combine a first conductive filler having a larger average particle size with a second conductive filler having a smaller average particle size in a proportion meeting the closest packing theory distribution curve. An example would be mixing two aluminium oxide preparations having different average particle sizes. In other embodiments, different thermally conductive filler materials with difference sizes may be used, for example, a combination of an aluminium oxide having a larger average particle size with a zinc oxide having a smaller average particle size. Alternatively, it may be desirable to use combinations of metallic fillers, such as a first aluminium having a larger average particle size and a second aluminium having a smaller average particle size. Use of a first filler having a larger average particle size and a second filler having a smaller average particle size than the first filler may improve packing efficiency, may reduce viscosity, and may enhance heat transfer.
The shape of the thermally conductive filler particles is not specifically restricted, however, rounded or spherical particles may prevent viscosity increase to an undesirable level upon high loading of the thermally conductive filler in the composition. The average particle size of the thermally conductive filler will depend on various factors including the type of thermally conductive filler selected and the exact amount added to the curable composition, as well as the bondline thickness of the device in which the cured product of the composition will be used. In some particular instances, the thermally conductive filler may have an average particle size ranging from 0.1 micrometre to 80 micrometres, alternatively 0.1 micrometre to 50 micrometres, and alternatively 0.1 micrometre to 10 micrometres. The additional optional fillers may also be treated with treating agents as described above should the need arise.
Other optional additives include a surfactant, a flux agent, an acid acceptor, and/or an anti-corrosion additives and a combination thereof.
Suitable surfactants include silicone polyethers, ethylene oxide polymers, propylene oxide polymers, copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, other non-ionic surfactants, and combinations thereof. The composition may comprise up to 0.05% of the surfactant based on the weight of the composition.
Flux Agent
The composition may comprise up to 2% of a flux agent based on the weight of the composition. Molecules containing chemically active functional groups such as carboxylic acid and amines can be used as flux agents. Such flux agents can include aliphatic acids such as succinic acid, abietic acid, oleic acid, and adipic acid; aromatic acids such as benzoic acids; aliphatic amines and their derivatives, such as triethanolamine, hydrochloride salts of amines, and hydrobromide salts of amines. Flux agents are known in the art and are commercially available.
Acid Acceptor
Suitable acid acceptors include magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, and combinations thereof. The composition may comprise up to 2% of Acid Acceptor based on the weight of the composition, if appropriate.
Anti corrosion additives, such as nitrogen/sulphur containing heterocyclic compounds containing a triazole structure, a thiadiazole structure, a benzotriazole structure, a mercaptothiozole structure, a mercaptobenzothiazole structure or a benzimidazole structure.
As previously indicated the condensation curable composition is stored in a multiple part manner, typically in two parts and polymer (i), cross-linker (ii) and catalyst (iv) are not all stored together in the same part. Furthermore hydrous filler (iii) and the catalyst (iv) are typically kept separate with the filler (iii) being mixed into the polymer (i). The two parts of the composition may be mixed using any appropriate standard two-part mixing equipment with a dynamic or static mixer and the resulting mixture is optionally dispensed therefrom for use in the application for which it is intended. The two part composition might for example comprise any one of the following alternatives:
1) stored in two parts Part A having polymer (i) and cross-linker (ii) and Part B having polymer (i) and catalyst (iii); or
2) stored in two parts Part A having polymer (i) and catalyst (iv) and Part B having cross-linker (ii) or
3) stored in two parts, Part A having a first polymer (i) and cross-linker (ii) and Part B having second polymer (i) and catalyst (iv) or
4) stored in two parts, Part A containing polymer (i) and part B containing the cross-linker (ii) and catalyst (iv). Typically the filler (iii) is stored in the part which does not contain the catalyst.
The composition may alternatively be stored in 3 or more parts should the need arise. Additional additives are generally added into Part A, whilst it is anticipated that the vast majority if not all moisture in the composition will be in the hydrous filler, should any other ingredient including the optional ingredients contain moisture (water) in any form the amount of catalyst will be determined based on the total moisture content from all sources which is the value determined through ISO 787-2:1981.
There is also provided herein a method of making an elastomer or gel material as hereinbefore described whereby the aforementioned two parts of the composition are intermixed and cured. Subsequent to intermixing in one embodiment the condensation curable elastomer or gel composition may be applied on to a substrate using a suitable dispenser such as for example curtain coaters, spray devices die coaters, dip coaters, extrusion coaters, knife coaters and screen coaters which upon elastomer or gel formation provides a coating on said substrate.
Gels or elastomers in accordance with the above may be utilised in a wide variety of applications, including, for the sake of example as an encapsulant/pottant in an electronic article.
The article may be a power electronic article e.g. an electronic component with gel disposed thereon such
The article may be a power electronic article e.g. an electronic component with material composition disposed thereon such that the cured material encapsulates, either partially or completely, the electronic component. Alternatively the electronic article may be an integrated circuit (IC), or light emitting diodes (LED) system or may be a printed circuit board (PCB).
The silicone material as hereinbefore described is designed for use in optical applications and electronics applications, including both microelectronics and macroelectronics applications as well as optoelectronics applications and thermally conductive electronics applications, such as making thermally conductive adhesives. Furthermore, the silicone material of the present invention may be transparent and therefore are potentially suitable for use in light-emitting semiconductor elements such as LEDs.
Cured silicone adhesives prepared from such a curable silicone composition may adhere to various substrates such as electrical or electronic components and/or parts, not least metal substrates such as gold, silver, aluminum, copper, and electroless nickel; as well as polymeric substrates such as FR4, Nylon, polycarbonate, Lucite (which is polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and liquid crystal polymers such as Xydar®, available from Solvay Chemicals, Houston, Tex. 77098 USA.
The electrical or electronic components and/or parts may be filled with the silicone material by any appropriate method by, for example, contacting the portion of the electrical or electronic part to be protected with the silicone material, and then curing this composition by through condensation cure i.e. by letting it stand at room temperature.
Any suitable electrical or electronic part may be sealed with the silicone material as described above but because the silicone material of the present invention can suppress the occurrence of air bubbles and cracks and exhibits good bonding to electrical or electronic parts even under high-temperature conditions, it can be advantageously used in power devices used under high-temperature conditions, particularly power devices such as a motor control, a motor control for transport, a power generation system, or a space transportation system.
Furthermore, because the silicone material of the present invention has a certain degree of cold resistance in addition to the heat resistance demanded in an Si—C semiconductor chip (for example, heat resistance of 180° C. or above). The electronic article can be a power module, e.g. one of more of the aforementioned devices for power converters, inverters, boosters, traction controls, industrial motor controls, power distribution and transportation systems, especially in power devices that demand the ability to withstand sharp temperature differences, and can improve the durability and reliability of such power devices.
Examples of such power devices that demand heat resistance and cold resistance include motor controls used in cold regions such as general-purpose inverter controls, servo motor controls, machine tools or elevators, electric vehicles, hybrid cars or motor controls for rail transport used in cold regions, power generating systems used in cold regions such as solar, wind or fuel cell power generators, space transportation systems used in space, and the like. Note that “cold regions” indicates regions where the temperature falls below 0° C.
Furthermore, the silicone material is also effective in sealing electrical or electronic parts having a structure in which the space between electrodes, between electrical elements or between an electrical element and the package in the electrical or electronic part is narrow, or having a structure in which these structures cannot track to the expansion and contraction of the silicone material. For example, it may be used in electrical circuits or modules on which electrical elements such as semiconductor elements, capacitors and resistors are mounted, i.e., various sensors such as pressure sensors that are generally sealed or filled with silicone material, and automotive igniters, regulators and the like.
The electronic component may be defined as a chip, such as a silicon chip or a silicon carbide chip, one or more wires, one or more sensors, one or more electrodes, integrated circuits (ICs), e.g. hybrid ICs, power devices, insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), a rectifier such as a Schottky diode, a PiN diode, a merged PiN/Schottky (MPS) rectifier and Junction barrier diode, a bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), a thyristor, a metal oxide field effect transistor (MOSFET), a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), a static induction transistors (SIT), a power transistor, and the like.
The electronic article may include the electronic component and a first layer. The first layer is not particularly limited and may be a semiconductor, a dielectric, metal, plastic, carbon fibre mesh, metal foil, a perforated metal foil (mesh), a filled or unfilled plastic film (such as a polyamide sheet, a polyimide sheet, polyethylene naphthalate sheet, a polyethylene terephthalate polyester sheet, a polysulphone sheet, a polyether imide sheet, or a polyphenylene sulphide sheet), or a woven or nonwoven substrate (such as fibreglass cloth, fibreglass mesh, or aramid paper). Alternatively, the first layer may be further defined as a semiconductor and/or dielectric film.
The silicone material may be sandwiched between the electronic component and the first layer, and/or may be disposed on and in direct contact with the first layer, and/or on and in direct contact with the electronic component. If the silicone material is disposed on and in direct contact with the first layer, the silicone material may still be disposed on the electronic component but may include one or more layers or structures between the silicone material and the electronic component.
The disclosure also provides a method of forming aforementioned electronic article. The method may include one or more of the aforementioned steps of forming the elastomer or gel, the step of providing the elastomer or gel, and/or the step of providing the electronic component. Typically, the method includes the curable compositions as hereinbefore described onto an electronic component and curing the composition to form an elastomer or gel on the electronic component under the condition sufficient to form the elastomer or gel without damaging the component. The elastomer or gel may be formed on the electronic component. Alternatively, the elastomer or gel may be formed apart from the electronic component and subsequently be disposed on the electronic component.
Alternatively, the silicone elastomer or gel may be utilised in adhesive compositions for use as the skin-facing layer of a medical device or wound dressing. In addition to the silicone elastomer or gel adhesive composition, the medical device or wound dressing contains an absorbable or porous substrate. The absorbable substrate may be any material known to those of skill in the art capable of at least partially absorbing the exudate from a wound. Absorbable substrates include, but are not limited to, the following materials: foams (e.g., polyurethane and/or polymer foams), synthetic sponges, natural sponges, silks, keratins (e.g., wool and/or camel hair), cellulosic fibres (e.g., wood pulp fibres, cotton fibres, hemp fibres, jute fibres, and/or flax fibres), rayon, acetates, acrylics, cellulose esters, modacrylics, polymers, super-absorbent polymers (e.g., polymers capable of absorbing approximately 10 times their weight or greater), polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins, polyvinyl alcohols, and/or other materials. Combinations of one or more of the above-listed materials may also be used as the absorbable or porous substrate.
The silicone elastomer or gel as hereinbefore described may be incorporated in adhesive compositions for use as the skin-facing layer in various applications where suitable skin-facing adhesive materials are desired, e.g. in athletic apparel such as biking shorts and feminine hygiene products.
Other applications include the manufacturing of silicone adhesive tapes (e.g. polyurethane nonwoven/fabric with silicone elastomer or gel on it), elastomer or gel sheeting (e.g. polyurethane film with elastomer or gel on it), wound dressings (e.g. polyurethane film or polyurethane foam with elastomer or gel on it), bandages, adhesive strips, surgery drapes (e.g., polyethylene with gel on it), topical or transdermal patches, fragrance/cosmetics patches and the like. As most elastomer or gels prepared by curing the compositions described in this invention are visually crystal clear, these materials can be used to seal, glue or protect materials in optical devices or for any other purposes linked to its transparency. Still further potential applications include protection for light emitting diodes, gels or elastomers for implants and prosthesis, shoe sole, elastomers for drug release applications, and in tire industry as an anti-puncture material or a self-sealing pneumatic rubber tire. A self-sealing pneumatic rubber tire with a sealing band adheringly attached in the circumferential direction on the inner side of the tire, radially within the tread, with the elastomer or gel as herein before described applied on a carrier material. The invention also relates to a method for producing a self-sealing tire using a sealing band with a sealant applied on a carrier material, which sealing band is introduced into the tire and applied on the inner wall surface of the tire, running between the shoulder regions.

The terms “alkoxy”, “SiOR” may be used interchangeably in the scope of the present invention, to indicate a condensation curable silyl terminating group of a polymer, bearing at least one hydrolysable functional group.

Fumed silica is Cabot LM150. Its moisture content is about 0.78% in weight of the total combined composition determined by ISO 787-2:1981.
Preparation of the Curing Agent 1
379.15 g of dimethylhydroxy silyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane polymer exhibiting a viscosity at 23° C. of about 2000 mPa·s (Brookfield cone plate viscometer RV DIII using a cone plate CP-52 at 20 rpm) and 18.96 g of fumed silica were mixed together on two occasions for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. Subsequently, 1.90 g of tetra-n-butoxy titanate was added into the mixture and the whole composition was mixed on three occasions for 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer.
Preparation of the Curing Agent 2
379.15 g of dimethylhydroxy silyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane polymer exhibiting a viscosity at 23° C. of about 2000 mPa·s (Brookfield cone plate viscometer RV Dill using a cone plate CP-52 at 20 rpm) and 18.96 g of fumed silica were mixed together on two occasions for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. Subsequently, 0.88 g of tetra-n-butoxy titanate was added into the mixture and the whole composition was mixed on three occasions for 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer.
Preparation of the Curing Agent 3 (Comparative)
379.15 g of dimethylhydroxy silyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane polymer exhibiting a viscosity at 23° C. of about 2000 mPa·s (Brookfield cone plate viscometer RV Dill using a cone plate CP-52 at 20 rpm) and 18.96 g of fumed silica were mixed together on two occasions for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. Subsequently, 3.82 g of tetra-n-butoxy titanate is added and mixed for 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. The material formed a gel, which cannot be used as a curing agent. This is because the ratio of catalyst to moisture content results in the titanate being hydrolysed losing its catalytic activity and gelling with the polymer. Hence, curing Agent 3 will not function as a curing agent.
Example 1
50 g of the curing agent 1 is mixed with 0.095 g of 1,6-bis (trimethoxysilyl)hexane with the help of a dental mixer for 30 seconds at 3200 rpm. The material was poured into a 50 ml aluminium cup and left to cure at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity.
Example 2
50 g of the curing agent 1 is mixed with 0.190 g of 1,6-bis (trimethoxysilyl)hexane with the help of a dental mixer for 30 seconds at 3200 rpm. The material was poured into a 50 ml aluminium cup and left to cure at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity.
Example 3
50 g of the curing agent 1 is mixed with 0.284 g of 1,6-bis (trimethoxysilyl)hexane with the help of a dental mixer for 30 seconds at 3200 rpm. The material was poured into a 50 ml aluminium cup and left to cure at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity.
Example 4
50 g of the curing agent 1 is mixed with 0.379 g of 1,6-bis (trimethoxysilyl)hexane with the help of a dental mixer for 30 seconds at 3200 rpm. The material was poured into a 50 ml aluminium cup and left to cure at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity.
Example 5
50 g of the curing agent 1 is mixed with 0.484 g of 1,6-bis (trimethoxysilyl)hexane with the help of a dental mixer for 30 seconds at 3200 rpm. The material was poured into a 50 ml aluminium cup and left to cure at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity.
Example 6
50 g of the curing agent 1 is mixed with 0.948 g of 1,6-bis (trimethoxysilyl)hexane with the help of a dental mixer for 30 seconds at 3200 rpm. The material was poured into a 50 ml aluminium cup and left to cure at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity.
Example 7
50 g of the curing agent 1 is mixed with 1.896 g of 1,6-bis (trimethoxysilyl)hexane with the help of a dental mixer for 30 seconds at 3200 rpm. The material was poured into a 50 ml aluminium cup and left to cure at 23° C. and 50% relative humidity.
Counter Examples 1 to 7
A series of comparative examples were undertaken. They were identical to the above examples 1 to 7 other than Curing Agent 1 being replaced by curing Agent 2. It was found that the compositions generated containing curing Agent 2 as described above did not cure. The molar content of titanate catalyst in this formulation is below 50% of the molar content of moisture.
In Table 1 below physical properties of the cured products from examples 1 to 7 were analysed. A TA XT plus texture analyser from Stable Micro systems is used to monitor the hardness (Force) of the curing or cured elastomer or gel. The probe used is a polycarbonate cylinder terminated by a spherical end. The diameter of the probe and sphere is ½ inch (1.27 cm). A return to start program is used. The pre-test speed was 5 mm/s and the trigger force was 0.1 g (no measurement until trigger force is 0.1 g). The test speed used was 1 mm/s. The probe was inserted to a distance of 5 mm in the cured material and then removed to a distance where no significant force is measured i.e. measures force needed in g to go down 5 mm within the material sample being tested and then similarly when the probe has penetrated the sample by 5 mm it returns to its starting position and the force need to return to the starting position is measured. The latter value is typically zero as material hard (negative force=tackiness) system can therefore measure hardness and tackiness. The maximum positive force is measured and reported here.
Appearance was determined by touching gently the surface with the finger. If the material was easy to deform with the finger it was reported as being a gel. If not it was reported as being an elastomer.

It can be seen that examples 1 to 6 are fast curing materials, which exhibit a bulk cure after a few hours. Example 7 is showing a skin cure in the early time of cure, i.e. only the surface is cured, not the bulk of the material. Bulk cure is however achieved later in between 48 h and 7 days. Example 7 is consider to be curing as a standard diffusion cure one part titanate, while other examples are curing as standard bulk cure two part condensation systems. Example 1 to 7 have a molar content of titanate catalyst in this formulation is above 50% of the molar content of moisture in opposition to their respective comparative examples.
Comparative Examples 8 & 9, According to WO2013100175
Comparative Example 8
This comparative example is derived from Example 1 of WO2013100175, which described two-part formulations where tin is used as catalyst.
Part A
51.9 g of Hydroxydimethylsilyl terminated polydimethyl siloxane exhibiting a viscosity at 23° C. of about 4,000 mPa·s (Brookfield cone plate viscometer RV DIII using a cone plate CP-52 at 20 rpm) was mixed with 25.95 g of trimethylsilyl terminated polydimethyl siloxane exhibiting a viscosity at 23° C. of about 100 mPa·s (Brookfield cone plate viscometer RV DIII using a cone plate CP-52 at 20 rpm) for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. Then 51.9 g of Sikron SF600 Quartz powder was added and mixed for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. Finally, 0.26 g of deionized water was added in the mixture and mixed for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer.

Mixture of Part A and Part B
130 g of part A was mixed with 2.7 g of part B for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer 4 times.
Comparative Example 9
This comparative example is using formulation of comparative example 8 replacing the tin catalyst by titanate catalyst.
51.9 g of Hydroxydimethylsilyl terminated polydimethyl siloxane exhibiting a viscosity at 23° C. of about 4,000 mPa·s (Brookfield cone plate viscometer RV DIII using a cone plate CP-52 at 20 rpm) was mixed with 25.95 g of trimethylsilyl terminated polydimethyl siloxane exhibiting a viscosity at 23° C. of about 100 mPa·s for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. Then 51.9 g of Sikron SF600 Quartz powder was added and mixed for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer. Finally, 0.26 g of deionized water was added in the mixture and mixed for a period of 30 seconds at 2000 rpm in a speedmixer.

The results show unequivocally that despite the teaching of WO2013100175 that a titanate catalyst may be used in alternative to the tin catalyst, comparative example 9 shows unequivocally that the replacement of a tin catalyst by a titanate catalyst is not suitable, as it leads to a non-curing product. Moisture content in Sikron SF600 is around 0.24% in weight determined by ISO 787-2:1981. 40 parts of sikron contains 0.0053 mole parts of water. Additionally, 0.2 weight parts of water is added, which is equivalent to 0.011 molar parts in the formulation, which makes a total of 0.0163 mole part of water. 0.04 weight parts of Tetra n-butyl titanate is equivalent of 0.0000588 molar parts of catalyst, which is significantly below 50% of the molar portion of water present in the formulation as prescribed in the current disclosure.

Here again, despite the teaching of WO2007117551 and WO2007117552 that a tin catalyst may be replaced by a titanate catalyst, Comparative example 10 and 11 indicate that the mere replacement of a tin catalyst by a titanate based catalyst simply leads to a material which cures only at the surface but not in the bulk of the product which is occurring in the present compositions. Moisture content of Aerosil R8200 and Aerosil R974 were found to be around 0.32 and 0.29% in weight determined by ISO 787-2:1981. There are 18 weight parts of Aerosil R8200 and 1.2 weight parts of Aerosil R974, which represents about 0.00339 molar parts of moisture in the mixed formulation. There is 0.095 weight part of titanate, which represents about 0.000279 molar parts of catalyst in the mixed formulation, which is much below 50% of the molar part of water present in the formulation as prescribed in the current disclosure.

TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition formulated with a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound as an emulsifying agent or a co-emulsifying agent, and to a resin composition containing such an emulsion composition.
BACKGROUND ART
Resin compositions of urethane resins, acrylic resins and the like are divided into solvent-based systems which use organic solvents to provide good film formability and water-based systems which, due to concerns over environmental contamination, do not include organic solvents. Owing to concerns over organic solvents evaporating in the drying step and adversely affecting worker health, solvent-based resin compositions most often use high-boiling organic solvents such as N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF).
Artificial leathers and synthetic leathers that have been internal addition treated or surface treated with a solvent-based or water-based resin composition are used in such applications as automobile seats, furniture and apparel, and are desired to have gloss, slippage and leveling ability. Highly polymerized polydimethylsiloxanes are included so as to satisfy the need for slippage and wear resistance. In order to be able to include polydimethylsiloxanes both in solvent-based resin compositions and in water-based resin compositions, emulsification or the like must be carried out to enable the polydimethylsiloxane to disperse both in DMF and in water. However, when a polydimethylsiloxane emulsion composition obtained by emulsification with a nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant or a cationic surfactant is included in a DMF or other solvent-based resin composition, it does not uniformly disperse, as a result of which an emulsified state cannot be maintained and the polydimethylsiloxane separates out. Accordingly, there has existed a desire for the development of highly polymerized polydimethylsiloxane emulsion compositions that are capable of dispersing in both solvents such as DMF and in water.
Emulsion compositions that are stable to solvents have hitherto been developed. Patents relating to emulsion compositions which include polar solvents such as alcohols are described below.
Patent Document 1: JP No. 3023250 discloses an oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic containing a cyclic silicone, a surfactant, a highly polymerized pendant polyoxyalkylene-modified silicone, ethanol and titanium oxide. A polyoxyalkylene-modified silicone in which silicone side chains are modified with short-chain polyoxyalkylene groups is used, which differs in structure from that of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound included in the emulsion composition of the present invention. Also, an emulsion composition of a cyclic silicone is mentioned, and so the object of this art is not the emulsification of a highly polymerized organopolysiloxane.
Patent Document 2: JP No. 3417567 discloses an emulsion of an oil and a lower alcohol obtained with a pendant polyoxyalkylene-modified silicone. By using a pendant polyoxyalkylene-modified silicone as the emulsifying agent, the emulsion is stable even when it includes a high concentration of alcohol. This art uses a polyoxyalkylene-modified silicone having silicone side chains modified with short-chain polyoxyalkylene groups, which silicone differs in structure from the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound included in the emulsion composition of the present invention. Also, emulsion compositions in which the base oil is a liquid paraffin, a higher alcohol, a silicone oil or the like are given as examples, and so the object of this art is not the emulsification of highly polymerized organopolysiloxanes.
Patent Document 3: JP No. 3633820 discloses an emulsion which is intended for use as a cosmetic and includes a polysiloxane obtained from a polyoxyalkylene-modified silicone that is modified at both ends, a powder treated for water repellency, and ethanol. Because the emulsion composition of the present invention does not include a treated powder, the compounding ingredients are different. Also, emulsion compositions containing cyclic siloxanes and 6 cs low-viscosity polysiloxanes as the base oil are mentioned as examples, and so the object of this art is not the emulsification of highly polymerized organopolysiloxanes.
Patent Document 4: JP No. 5646355 discloses an emulsion which is intended for use as a cosmetic and includes a polydimethylsiloxane, a polyether-modified silicone and a lower alcohol. The polydimethylsiloxane has a viscosity of from 20 to 10,000 mm2/s, which differs from the viscosity of the organopolysiloxane of the present invention.
In addition, patents relating to resin compositions obtained by formulating urethane resin compositions for artificial leather or synthetic resin with polydimethylsiloxanes are described.
Patent Document 5: JP-A 2014-80713 discloses the formulation of a solid dimethylsilicone in a urethane resin, and the use of the resulting composition as a surface treatment agent for synthetic resins. A non-emulsified dimethylsilicone is used, and appears to be incapable of being blended into a water-based resin composition. Accordingly, this does not disperse in solvent-based or water-based resin compositions, and so this art differs from the emulsion composition of the present invention.
Patent Example 6: JP-A 2007-314919 discloses a water-based resin composition which includes, together with a urethane resin: a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent, a silicone compound and a filler. The silicone compound is a polyether-modified silicone. Hence, this art differs from the emulsion composition of the present invention which is obtained by emulsifying a highly polymerized organopolysiloxane.
In addition, a patent relating to a paint that includes a polydimethylsiloxane and a polyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane is described.
Patent Example 7: JP 5186079 discloses a paint additive which is a mixture of a silicone modified at one end with a polyether and a nonionic surfactant, which can persistently impart a slight degree of hydrophilicity to the surface of a coating film, and the purpose of which is to exhibit an ability to prevent fouling by aquatic organisms over an extended period of time. The present invention was developed with the object of imparting slippage and wear resistance to synthetic resins, artificial resins and the like used in automobiles and bags. Hence, the art described here differs from the present invention both in its makeup and in the intended use.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition in which a highly polymerized organopolysiloxane capable of dispersing in both solvents such as DMF and in water is emulsified. Another object is to provide a resin composition formulated with the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition, which resin composition is useful as a surface treatment agent or an internally added treatment agent that imparts slippage and wear resistance to synthetic resins and artificial resins used in automobiles and bags.
Solution to Problem
The inventors have conducted extensive investigations in order to achieve the above objects. As a result, they have discovered that a highly polymerized organopolysiloxane can be easily emulsified by using a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound of a specific structure as an emulsifying agent or a co-emulsifying agent. They have also found that, because the resulting organopolysiloxane emulsion composition has an excellent solvent resistance to polar solvents such as DMF and disperses in water as well, whether included in a resin composition that is solvent-based or water-based, it is able to impart slippage and wear resistance. These discoveries ultimately led to the present invention.
Accordingly, this invention provides the following organopolysiloxane emulsion composition and resin composition.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
The invention is described in detail below.
[Organopolysiloxane Emulsion Composition]
The organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention is characterized by including:
(A) from 1 to 50 parts by weight of a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound of general formula (1) below,
(B) from 0 to 50 parts by weight of a surfactant,
(C) 100 parts by weight of an organopolysiloxane having a viscosity at 25° C. of at least 15,000 mPa·s, and
(D) from 0 to 10,000 parts by weight of water.
[(A) Polyoxyalkylene-Modified Organopolysiloxane Compound]
The polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound serving as component (A) is a compound of general formula (1) below.
[Chem. 4]
(LR2SiO1/2)a(R3SiO1/2)b(R2SiO2/2)c(RSiO3/2)d(SiO4/2)e   (1)
Here, L is a polyoxyalkylene group of general formula (2) below
[Chem. 5]
—H2C—CH2—(CH2)r—O-(EO)s-(AO)t—R1   (2)
(wherein EO represents an oxyethylene group; AO represents a linear or branched oxyalkylene group of 3 to 10 carbon atoms; R1 is a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a hydrogen atom, a carboxyl group, an acyl group of 2 to 10 carbon atoms or a phenyl group; the subscript r is an integer from 0 to 10; the subscript s is an integer from 1 to 100; the subscript t is an integer from 0 to 150; and the sum s+t is 15 or more). Each R, which may be the same or different, is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl group of 6 to 20 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group of 7 to 20 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms; the subscript a is an integer from 2 to 4; the subscript b is an integer from 0 to 2; the subscript c is an integer from 50 to 1,000; the subscript d is 0 or 1; and the subscript e is 0 or 1.
By having the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound of component (A) serve as a co-emulsifying agent or emulsifying agent for the subsequently described organopolysiloxane (C), a highly polymerized organopolysiloxane can be easily emulsified and the particle size of the emulsion can be made small. In particular, an organopolysiloxane (C) having a viscosity of 20,000,000 mPa·s or more has difficulty emulsifying with the surfactant (B) alone, but can readily emulsify with the inclusion of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A). By including a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention manifests solvent resistance and salt resistance.
In formula (1) above, each R, which may be the same or different, is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl group of 6 to 20 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group of 7 to 20 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms include alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl and octyl groups; and halogen-substituted alkyl groups such as chloromethyl, chloropropyl, bromoethyl and trifluoropropyl groups. Examples of aryl groups of 6 to 20 carbon atoms include phenyl, tolyl, xylyl and naphthyl groups. Examples of aralkyl groups of 7 to 20 carbon atoms include benzyl, phenylethyl and phenylpropyl groups. Examples of alkoxy groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms include methoxy, ethoxy and propoxy groups. R is preferably a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or an aryl group of 6 to 20 carbon atoms. From the standpoint of versatility, a methyl group or a phenyl group is more preferred.
The subscript a is an integer of 2 to 4; the subscript b is an integer of 0 to 2; the subscript c is an integer of 50 to 1,000, preferably an integer of 100 to 800, and more preferably an integer of 200 to 600; the subscript d is 0 or 1; and the subscript e is 0 or 1.
L is a polyoxyalkylene group of above formula (2).
In formula (2), R1 is a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a hydrogen atom, a carboxyl group, an acyl group of 2 to 10 carbon atoms or a phenyl group. Examples of linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups of 1 to 10 carbon atoms include alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl and octyl groups; and halogen-substituted alkyl groups such as chloromethyl, chloropropyl, bromoethyl and trifluoropropyl groups. Examples of acyl groups of 2 to 10 carbon atoms include acetyl and octanoyl groups. R1 is preferably a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or a hydrogen atom. In terms of the ease of synthesis, a hydrogen atom is more preferred.
EO represents an oxyethylene group, and AO represents a linear or branched oxyalkylene group of 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples of AO include oxypropylene, oxybutylene and oxytetramethylene groups.
As for the subscripts r, s and t, r is an integer from 0 to 10, s is an integer from 1 to 100, t is an integer from 0 to 150, and the sum s+t≥15. It is preferable for s to be an integer of 1 to 80 and t to be an integer from 0 to 100, and more preferable for s to be an integer from 3 to 50 and t to be an integer from 3 to 50. When s is larger than 100 or t is larger than 150, the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) has too high a viscosity and becomes difficult to handle. The sum s+t in the average structural formula for one molecule is 15 or more, and preferably 25 or more. At less than 15, the solvent resistance of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition formulated with the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) decreases, and when the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition is dispersed in a polar solvent such as an alcohol or a ketone, the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition breaks down and the silicone ingredient separates out.
EO and AO may be in a block or random arrangement. The subscript r should satisfy the above-indicated value, although from the standpoint of versatility, it is most preferable for r to be 1.
The polyoxyalkylene group of formula (2) is exemplified by, but not limited to, groups of the following general formulas
(wherein EO stands for ethylene oxide, PO stands for propylene oxide, and BO stands for butylene oxide).
Component (A) is preferably, of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compounds of above formula (1), a linear polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound of general formula (3) below having polyoxyalkylene groups at both ends
(wherein L and R are as defined above, and the subscript n is an integer from 50 to 1,000).
In formula (3), n is an integer from 50 to 1,000, preferably an integer from 100 to 800, and more preferably an integer from 200 to 600. When n is smaller than 50, the solvent resistance of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition containing the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) decreases and films of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition-containing resin composition of the invention have decreased gloss. When n is larger than 1,000, the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) has a higher viscosity and becomes difficult to handle. Also, the emulsifying power of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) decreases and so the emulsion within the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention does not achieve a small average particle size.
In cases where two or more types of polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) are mixed together, the average structural formula should satisfy the range specified above.
The polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound serving as component (A) is exemplified by, but not limited to, compounds of the following formulas.
In the above formulas, Ph stands for a phenyl group, EO stands for ethylene oxide, and PO stands for propylene oxide. EO and PO may be in a block or random arrangement.
The polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) has a molecular weight of preferably from 8,500 to 100,000, more preferably from 10,000 to 90,000, and even more preferably from 15,000 to 90,000. At a molecular weight below 8,500, the solvent resistance of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition containing polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) may decrease, whereas at more than 100,000, the viscosity is high and handling may be difficult. Here and below, the molecular weight is the polystyrene-equivalent weight-average molecular weight obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using the HLC 8220 system from to Tosoh Corporation and using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent.
The polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) has a viscosity of preferably at least 5,000 mPa·s, more preferably at least 9,000 mPa·s, and even more preferably at least 15,000 mPa·s. At a viscosity below 5,000 mPa·s, the solvent resistance of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition containing the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) may decrease and films of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition-containing resin composition of the invention may have a decreased gloss. Here and below, the viscosity is a value measured at 25° C. using a BM- or BH-type rotational viscometer.
As shown in formula (1), molecules of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) may include not only [R2SiO2/2] units, but also [RSiO3/2] units and [SiO4/2] units. By including [RSiO3/2] units and [SiO4/2] units within molecules of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), there is a possibility that films of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition-containing resin composition of the invention will have improved wear resistance.
Preparation of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) may be carried out by a known method.
One example is the synthesis of a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound by the hydrosilylation of an unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound of general formula (5) below with a terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound of general formula (4) below in the presence of a hydrosilylation catalyst, either in a solvent or in the absence of a solvent.
<Terminal Silicon-Bonded Hydrogen Atom-Containing Organopolysiloxane Compound>
(HR2SiO1/2)a(R3SiO1/2)b(R2SiO2/2)c(RSiO3/2)d(SiO4/2)e   (4)
In this formula, R, a, b, c, d and e are as defined above.
<Unsaturated Hydrocarbon Group-Containing Polyoxyalkylene Compound>
[Chem. 15]
H2C═CH2—(CH2)r—O-(EO)s-(AO)t—R1   (5)
In this formula, EO, AO, R1, r, s and t are as defined above.
In the terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound, even in cases where two or more terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compounds are mixed together, the average structural formula should satisfy the range specified in formula (4).
It is possible to include not only [R2SiO2/2] units, but also [RSiO3/2] units and [SiO4/2] units within molecules of the terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound of formula (4). There is a possibility that, by including [RSiO3/2] units and [SiO4/2] units within molecules of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), the wear resistance of films of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition-containing resin composition of the invention will be improved.
Among terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compounds of formula (4), linear organopolysiloxane compounds which contain silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms at both ends of general formula (6) below are preferred.
In this formula, R and n are as defined above.
The terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound of formula (4) is exemplified by, but not limited to, those of the following formulas.
In these formulas, Ph stands for a phenyl group, Rf stands for a trifluoropropyl group, and the subscripts p and q are each integers of 0 or more, with the sum p+q being from 50 to 1,000.
In the unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound, it is also possible to use in admixture two or more types of unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compounds that satisfy general formula (5). When mixing together two or more types of unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compounds, the average structural formula of the mixed oils should satisfy the above-mentioned range of general formula (5).
The unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound of formula (5) is exemplified by, but not limited to, those of the following formulas.
In these formulas, EO stands for ethylene oxide, PO stands for propylene oxide, and BO stands for butylene oxide. EO, PO and BO may be in random or block arrangements.
The number of moles of unsaturated hydrocarbon groups in the unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound of formula (5) is preferably at least 0.7 equivalent and less than 2.0 equivalents, and more preferably at least 1.0 equivalent and less than 2.0 equivalents, with respect to the number of moles of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms on the terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound of formula (4). At less than 0.7 equivalent, the hydrophilicity of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) decreases and there is a possibility that the compound will not function as an emulsifying agent or a co-emulsifying agent. At 2.0 equivalents or more, during preparation of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), a large amount of unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound of formula (5) remains unreacted and there is a possibility of this affecting the emulsifiability and other properties of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A). In cases where the number of moles of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in formula (4) is larger than the number of moles of unsaturated hydrocarbon groups in formula (5) and hydrogen atoms remain following the hydrosilylation reaction, the amount of remaining silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms can be lowered by adding an olefin such as hexene or heptene and further carrying out hydrosilylation.
The hydrosilylation catalyst used in hydrosilylation is a catalyst for accelerating the hydrosilylation reaction. Exemplary catalysts include platinum catalysts, rhodium catalysts and palladium catalysts, with platinum catalysts being preferred. Examples of platinum catalysts include chloroplatinic acid, alcohol-modified chloroplatinic acid, olefin complexes of platinum, ketone complexes of platinum, vinylsiloxane complexes of platinum, platinum tetrachloride, finely powdered platinum, solid platinum loaded on an alumina or silica support, platinum black, olefin complexes of platinum, alkenylsiloxane complexes of platinum and carbonyl complexes of platinum. From the standpoint of stability and versatility, chloroplatinic acid or a vinylsiloxane complex of platinum is preferred. The catalyst content is not particularly limited so long as it is an effective amount, although the content is preferably such that the weight of catalyst metal is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 1,000 ppm, and more preferably in the range of 0.5 to 100 ppm, with respect to the combined weight of the terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound and the unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound.
The solvent used in the hydrosilylation reaction is exemplified by aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and xylene, hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane and octane, ether solvents such as dibutyl ether, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran (THF), ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, ketone solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), alcohol solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol and 1-butanol, and organic solvents such as chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents.
Relative to a combined amount of the terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound and the unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound of 100 parts by weight, the solvent content is from 0 to 1,000 parts by weight. When a solvent is used, the solvent content is preferably at least 50 parts by weight. At a low solvent content, the hydrosilylation reaction may proceed slowly. On the other hand, at a high solvent content, solvent waste increases, causing environment contamination.
In cases where an alcohol solvent is used, it is preferable to use a pH adjustor such as potassium acetate in order to prevent or suppress the dehydrogenation reaction (JP-B S62-34039).
It is desirable for the reaction temperature of hydrosilylation to be in the range of 50 to 150° C. At a reaction temperature lower than 50° C., the reaction rate may decline. At a reaction temperature higher than 150° C., unsaturated hydrocarbons internally migrate and the hydrosilylation reaction may not proceed. The reaction time is preferably from 2 to 15 hours.
The hydrosilylation reaction when preparing the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) is described in detail. In a nitrogen atmosphere, a terminal silicon-bonded hydrogen atom-containing organopolysiloxane compound, an unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing polyoxyalkylene compound and isopropyl alcohol as the solvent are heated, bringing the internal temperature to 75° C. Next, a toluene solution of a vinylsiloxane complex of platinum is added and the system is stirred for 8 hours, thereby synthesizing the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A).
In addition, by heating and reducing the pressure, the isopropyl alcohol solvent can be driven off. At this time, at a temperature higher than 120° C., the alkyl ether sites may oxidize. It is thus desirable to carry out the reaction at below 120° C.
Also, in the above method, following hydrosilylation, deodorization by removing allyl ether groups with an acidic substance or by alkylation via a hydrogenation reaction may be carried out. Tocopherol or dibutylhydroxytoluene (BHT) may be added as an antioxidant to the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) thus obtained.
There are cases in which the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), depending on the structure, takes the form of a paste, gel or solid and does not have flowability. Generally, when preparing a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) which does not have flowability, preparation in an organic solvent is preferable because the hydrosilylation reaction proceeds efficiently.
Also, if the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) is in the form of a paste, gel or solid that lacks flowability, it may not effectively disperse during emulsification, making it impossible to emulsify the organopolysiloxane (C). At such times, use is made of: an organic solvent solution of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), a nonionic surfactant (B-1) solution of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), an aqueous solution of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), or a nonionic surfactant (B-1) solution of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) that has itself been dissolved in water.
An organic solvent that dissolves component (A) should be used in the organic solvent solution of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A). The organic solvent used in preparing component (A) may be used directly for this purpose. The nonionic surfactant (B-1) solution (dissolved product) of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) may be prepared by adding the subsequently described nonionic surfactant (B-1) to the above organic solvent solution (dissolved product) of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) and carrying out heating and pressure reduction. When solvent displacing a solution (dissolved product) of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) with the nonionic surfactant (B-1), it is essential to select a nonionic surfactant which has a vapor pressure that is lower than the vapor pressure of the organic solvent so that only the organic solvent is driven off and the nonionic surfactant (B-1) is not driven off.
The method of preparing the nonionic surfactant (B-1) solution (dissolved product) of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) is as follows. The subsequently described nonionic surfactant (B-1) is added to an organic solvent solution of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), the pressure is reduced to from 3 to 50 mmHg and heating at from room temperature (20° C.) to 120° C. is carried out, thereby driving off the organic solvent and displacing it with the nonionic surfactant (B-1). The heating temperature at this time is preferably less than 120° C. At a temperature higher than 120° C., the alkyl ether sites may oxidize. In cases where foaming arises when the solvent is driven off, it is also possible to add a defoamer.
[(B) Surfactant]
The surfactant serving as component (B) is exemplified by nonionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants.
Exemplary nonionic surfactants include polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers and other polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters and glycerin fatty acid esters. Specific examples of these include polyoxyethylene octyl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene octyl ether, polyoxyethylene nonyl ether, polyoxyethylene decyl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene decyl ether, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene tridecyl ether and polyoxyethylene cetyl ether. The use of reactive surfactants having functional groups is also possible.
Exemplary anionic surfactants include alkyl sulfates such as lauryl sulfate, alkylbenzenesulfonic acids and salts thereof, sulfuric acid esters of monoalkyl polyoxyethylene ethers, acetic acid salts of monoalkyl polyoxyethylene ethers, alkylnaphthylsulfonic acids and salts thereof, alkali metal sulforesinates, alkali metal sulfosuccinates, alkylphosphoric acids and salts thereof, phosphoric acid esters of monoalkyl polyoxyethylene ethers, sulfonated glyceryl esters of fatty acids, alkali metal salts of alkyl sulfates and sulfuric acid esters. Specific examples of these include lauryl sulfuric acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl polyoxyethylene ether sulfate, sodium lauryl polyoxyethylene ether acetate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, disodium lauryl polyoxyethylene sulfosuccinate, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate, sodium lauryl polyoxyethylene ether phosphate and sodium alkylnaphthalenesulfonate. The use of reactive surfactants having a functional group is also possible.
Exemplary cationic surfactants include alkylamines, quaternary ammonium salts, sulfonium salts, phosphonium salts and acetic acid salts. Specific examples include stearyl amine acetate, lauryltrimethylammonium chloride, cetyltrimethylammonium, stearyltrimethylammonium chloride and alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride.
Exemplary amphoteric surfactants include alkyl betaines and alkyl imidazolines. Specific examples of these include lauryldimethylaminoacetic acid betaine, lauryldimethylamine oxide and 2-alkyl-N-carboxymethyl-N-hydroxyethylimidazolinium betaine.
In the case of anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants, sometimes the uses are limited because the molecule bears a charge, and sometimes atoms such as sulfur or nitrogen included in the surfactant become catalyst poisons, hindering the reaction. In cases where the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention is formulated for uses in which the surfactant charge or catalyst poisoning is a concern, use should be made of only nonionic surfactants. From the standpoint of emulsifiability, the nonionic surfactant is preferably a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether or a polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester.
[(B-1) Nonionic Surfactant]
The nonionic surfactant is described in detail. Nonionic surfactants suitable for use in the present invention are nonionic surfactants which are liquid at 25° C. and which are capable of dissolving the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A). Examples include nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and other polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters and glycerin fatty acid esters. Specific examples of these include polyoxyethylene octyl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene octyl ether, polyoxyethylene nonyl ether, polyoxyethylene decyl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene decyl ether, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene tridecyl ether and polyoxyethylene cetyl ether. Of these nonionic surfactants, from the standpoint of emulsifiability, a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether or a polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester is preferred. Of these, ones for which the number of added moles of ethylene oxide is from 2 to 14 and the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) is from 7.5 to 15 are especially preferred. The HLB is determined by Griffin's method. Two or more nonionic surfactants may be mixed and used together, in which case the HLB of the mixed surfactants should satisfy the above value.
[(C) Organopolysiloxane]
The organopolysiloxane serving as component (C) is one having a viscosity at 25° C. of at least 15,000 mPa·s.
Examples of organopolysiloxane include cyclic siloxanes, methylhydrogenpolysiloxanes, dimethylpolysiloxanes, alkyl-modified polysiloxanes, aralkyl-modified polysiloxanes, vinyl-modified polysiloxanes, amino-modified polysiloxanes, amino acid-modified polysiloxanes, fluorine-modified polysiloxanes, epoxy-modified polysiloxanes, (meth)acryl-modified polysiloxanes, hydroxy-modified polysiloxanes and phenyl-modified polysiloxanes. From the standpoint of versatility, preferred examples include dimethylpolysiloxanes, hydroxy-modified polysiloxanes and phenyl-modified polysiloxanes.
The organopolysiloxane has a viscosity at 25° C. of at least 15,000 mPa·s, preferably from 500,000 to 100,000,000 mPa·s, and more preferably from 750,000 to 100,000,000 mPa·s. At a viscosity lower than 15,000 mPa·s, the slippage is low and the gloss of a film of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition-containing resin composition of the invention may decrease. At a viscosity higher than 100,000,000 mPa·s, the strain on the equipment during emulsification may be heavy.
Two or more organopolysiloxanes may be mixed together and used as component (C), in which case the viscosity of the mixed organopolysiloxanes should satisfy the above range.
In the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention, the content of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) is from 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 40 parts by weight, and more preferably from 3 to 35 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the organopolysiloxane (C). At a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) content below 1 part by weight, due to a decrease in emulsifiability, the organopolysiloxane (C) may not emulsify. Also, the solvent resistance and salt resistance of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition may decrease. On the other hand, at a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) content of more than 50 parts by weight, the transparency of the film of organopolysiloxane emulsion composition-containing resin composition may decrease.
In cases where the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention does not include water as component (D), component (C) disperses and emulsifies in components (A) and (B). In cases where the composition includes water as component (D), component (C) disperses and emulsifies only in component (D) and/or component (A) and/or component (B).
In the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention, the content of the surfactant (B) is from 0 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 3 to 40 parts by weight, and more preferably from 5 to 35 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the organopolysiloxane (C). In cases where the organopolysiloxane (C) can be emulsified with the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) alone, a surfactant (B) need not be included. A surfactant (B) content of more than 50 parts by weight may impair the wear resistance of the film of the inventive resin composition.
When a surfactant (B) is used, the weight ratio between the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) and the surfactant (B) is not specified, although it is desirable for the weight ratio (polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A)/surfactant (B)) to be at least 0.1, preferably from 0.2 to 10.0, and more preferably from 0.5 to 5.0. When the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) and the surfactant (B) are used as emulsifying agents or co-emulsifying agents for the organopolysiloxane (C), a ratio below 0.1 may lower the emulsifying strength with respect to the organopolysiloxane (C) and may lower the solvent resistance of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition.
The combined amount of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) and the surfactant (B) is not particularly specified, although this is typically from 5 to 100 parts by weight, preferably from 10 to 75 parts by weight, and more preferably from 25 to 75 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the organopolysiloxane (C). When the combined amount of the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) and the surfactant (B) is less than 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the organopolysiloxane (C), it may not be possible to emulsify the organopolysiloxane (C) or the emulsion may be unstable. On the other hand, a combined amount in excess of 100 parts by weight by weight may impair the wear resistance of a film of the resulting resin composition.
[(D) Water]
In the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention, water (D) should be included where necessary from the standpoint of the required form of the manufactured article (e.g., self-emulsifying type, emulsion type), emulsifiability and the like. Therefore, the water (D) content, based on an organopolysiloxane (C) content of 100 parts by weight, is from 0 to 10,000 parts by weight, preferably from 0 to 5,000 parts by weight, and more preferably from 0 to 1,000 parts by weight. At more than 10,000 parts by weight, the stability may decrease and separation may become large. At a water (D) content within the above range, the particle size does not change over time. When emulsification of the organopolysiloxane (C) is possible with the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) and the surfactant (B), there is no need to include water (D). When including an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition in a solvent-based resin composition in particular, if water is present within the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition, depending on the type of solvent, separation from the water may occur, preventing uniformity from being achieved. In such cases, it is preferable to use an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition that contains no water.
[Preparation of Composition]
Specific methods for emulsifying the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention are primarily as indicated below. A first method emulsifies a mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound, (B) the surfactant and (C) the organopolysiloxane, and then blends in (D) water. A second method emulsifies a mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound, (B) the surfactant, (C) the organopolysiloxane and (D) water. A third method emulsifies a mixture of (B) the surfactant, (C) the organopolysiloxane and (D) water, and then blends in (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound. A fourth method emulsifies a mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound, (C) the organopolysiloxane and (D) water, and then blends in (B) the surfactant. A fifth method emulsifies a mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound and (C) the organopolysiloxane, and then blends in (B) the surfactant and (D) water. The emulsification methods of the invention are described in detail below.
The first emulsification method emulsifies a mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound, (B) the surfactant and (C) the organopolysiloxane using a planetary mixer, which is a two- or three-blade mixer that operates based on orbital revolution and own-axis rotation. After 2 to 180 minutes of agitation until a given particle size is achieved, additional polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), surfactant (B) or water (D) is added as needed and dilution is carried out with a planetary mixer, a dispersion mixer (a mixer based on the rotation of toothed blades) or a homogenizing mixer (a mixer based on the spinning of a rotor within a stator), thereby preparing the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition.
The second emulsification method is as follows. A mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound, (B) the surfactant, (C) the organopolysiloxane and (D) water is emulsified with a planetary mixer. After 2 to 180 minutes of agitation until a given particle size is achieved, additional (A) polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound, (B) surfactant or (D) water is added as needed and dilution is carried out with a planetary mixer, a dispersion mixer or a homogenizing mixer, thereby preparing an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition.
The third emulsification method is as follows. A mixture of (B) the surfactant, (C) the organopolysiloxane and (D) water is emulsified with a planetary mixer or dispersion mixer. After 2 to 180 minutes of agitation until a given particle size is achieved, the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A) and, as needed, surfactant (B) or water (D) is blended in and mixing is carried out with a planetary mixer, a dispersion mixer or a homogenizing mixer, thereby preparing an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition.
The fourth emulsification method is as follows. A mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound, (C) the organopolysiloxane and (D) water is emulsified with a planetary mixer or a dispersion mixer. After 2 to 180 minutes of agitation until a given particle size is achieved, additional polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), surfactant (B) or water (D) is added as needed and dilution is carried out with a planetary mixer, a dispersion mixer or a homogenizing mixer, thereby preparing an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition.
The fifth emulsification method is as follows. A mixture of (A) the polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound and (C) the organopolysiloxane is emulsified with a planetary mixer or a dispersion mixer. After 2 to 180 minutes of agitation until a given particle size is achieved, additional polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound (A), surfactant (B) or water (D) is added as needed and dilution is carried out with a planetary mixer, a dispersion mixer or a homogenizing mixer, thereby preparing an organopolysiloxane emulsion composition.
The concentration of the organopolysiloxane (C) in the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention is preferably in the range of 1 to 90 wt %. At less than 1 wt %, the stability of the emulsion composition becomes a problem; at more than 90 wt %, the viscosity of the emulsion is high, making the composition difficult to handle. Also, depending on the makeup of the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition, separation may occur over time. In such cases, separation can sometimes be suppressed by reducing the content of water included in the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition.
The temperature during emulsification is preferably from 0 to 80° C., and more preferably from 0 to 40° C. At a temperature below 0° C. or a temperature higher than 80° C., there is a possibility that emulsion will not take place or that the emulsion produced will become unstable. Emulsification may be carried out not only at normal pressure, but even under reduced pressure or applied pressure. When emulsion is carried out at reduced pressure or under applied pressure, bubbles are less likely to be entrained and effective emulsification is sometimes possible. To avoid vaporization of the starting materials, care must be taken so that the pressure during pressure reduction is higher than the vapor pressure of the starting materials.
With regard to the emulsifier used during emulsification, it is necessary to select one which is capable of agitating the starting materials or the emulsion composition. Effective emulsification is possible by using, as a planetary mixer—which is a two- or three-blade mixer that operates based on orbital revolution and own-axis rotation, any of the following: the Gate Mixer (Inoue Manufacturing, Inc.), the Hivis Mix® (Primix Corporation), or the Hivis Disper Mix model 3D-5 (Primix Corporation), which is an agitator based on the orbital revolution and own-axis rotation of two blades and the high-speed rotation of a toothed blade. Alternatively, use can be made of a colloid mill having an agitating mechanism consisting of a rotor and a stator (such as those available from IKA, PUC, Nissei Corporation and Iwaki Co., Ltd.), and high-shear mixers (such as those available from Silverson and Primix Corporation). Use can also be made of the Homogenizing Disper (Primix Corporation), the Agi Homo Mixer (Primix Corporation), the Combi Mix® (Primix Corporation)—which is a three-shaft dispersion mixer that combines the Homogenizing Mixer, the Homogenizing Disper and the Anchor Mixer, the twin-screw mixer HAAKE MiniLab II (Thermo Scientific)—which has co-rotating screws or counter-rotating screws, and the MC 15 and MC 5 (Rheo Lab Ltd.). In cases where the three-shaft dispersion mixer Combi Mix® (Primix Corporation) or the Hivis Disper Mix (Primix Corporation) is used, emulsification with the Anchor Mixer alone is also possible.
Aside from the surfactant, the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention may also be formulated with, as a protective colloid or a thickener, a water-soluble polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, alginic acid salt, xanthan gum or an acrylic acid polymer. In addition, antimicrobial agents or preservatives such as oxazoline compounds and aromatic carboxylic acid salts, as well as fragrances, antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, dyes, fillers, curing catalysts, organic powders and inorganic powders may be included.
The average particle size of the emulsion of the inventive organopolysiloxane emulsion composition, although not here specified, is typically not more than 20 μm, preferably not more than 10 μm, and more preferably not more than 5 μm. At an average particle size larger than 20 μm, in cases where the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition has been dispersed in water or a solvent such as dimethylformamide, separation sometimes occurs immediately. In the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of the invention, when the average particle size of the emulsion is 1.5 μm or more, it can be measured using the Multisizer 3 from Beckman Coulter. When the emulsion has an average particle size of less than 1.5 μm, measurement may be carried out with the LA920 or LA960 from Horiba, Ltd. or with the N4 PLUS from Beckman Coulter. The average particle size, although it has no particular lower limit, is typically at least 0.1 μm, and preferably at least 0.5 μm.
[Resin Composition]
The organopolysiloxane emulsion composition of this invention may be used as a surface treatment agent or an internally added treatment agent for synthetic leather and artificial leather. By blending the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition in a resin composition composed primarily of an acrylic resin or a urethane resin, good slippage can be imparted.
Examples of the resin used in this resin composition include thermoset resins such as urethane resins, epoxy resins, phenolic resins, melamine resins, urea resins, alkyd resins and polyimide resins; and thermoplastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, tetrafluoroethylene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins, acrylonitrile-styrene resins and acrylic resins. From the standpoint of versatility, a urethane resin or an acrylic resin is preferred.
When blending the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition into a resin composition, the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition may be blended directly into the resin composition and uniformly dispersed, or it may first be dispersed in water or a solvent such as DMF or MEK and then blended into the resin composition. To uniformly mix the organopolysiloxane emulsion composition into the resin composition, use can be made of a known mixer, such as a homogenizing mixer, a Satake mixer, a static mixer, a Ross mixer, a Hobart mixer, a Henschel mixer, a paddle mixer or a ribbon mixer.
The amount of organopolysiloxane emulsion composition included in the resin composition is from 0.01 to 30 wt %, preferable from 0.1 to 20 wt %, and more preferably from 0.2 to 10 wt %, based on the resin solids. At a content of less than 0.01 wt %, slippage sometimes cannot be obtained. At a content of more than 30 wt %, the gloss and the leveling ability sometimes decrease.
Film-forming methods in which the resin composition of the invention is applied as a surface treatment agent to the surface of artificial leather or synthetic leather are exemplified by spraying methods that involve direct spraying, and direct coating methods with a gravure coater, a knife coater, a comma coater or an air-knife coater. From the standpoint of versatility and the stability of the resin composition, a direct coating method using a gravure coater is most preferred. With regard to the coating weight, the weight of the applied film after drying is preferably in the range of 3 to 100 g/m2, and more preferably in the range of 5 to 30 g/m2. At a film weight below 3 g/m2 or above 100 g/m2, a uniform resin layer does not readily form and unevenness in the gloss and the leveling ability may arise.
The drying conditions following application of the resin composition of the invention are not particularly limited, provided that the water or solvent within the resin composition evaporates and, where necessary, resin crosslinking reactions. Generally, heating at from 20 to 150° C. for a period of from about 10 seconds to about 5 minutes is preferred, and heating at from 80 to 130° C. for a period of from about 30 seconds to about 2 minutes is more preferred.
Methods of producing artificial leather in which the resin composition of the invention is included as an internally added treatment agent are exemplified as follows. The artificial leather is produced by applying the resin composition of the invention and various types of polymer compounds to a nonwoven sheet composed primarily of ultrafine fibers as the artificial leather starting material, and heating, drying and the like. Application to the nonwoven sheet may be carried out by any suitable method, such as impregnation, spraying or coating. Heating and drying methods are exemplified by hot air drying, infrared heating and radio-frequency heating. Taking into account equipment investment costs, ease of maintenance and the like, hot-air dryers are commonly used. The drying temperature is from 20 to 150° C. With heating at temperatures higher than 150° C., a decrease in the heat resistance of the resins and fiber deterioration become concerns.
In this invention, by having a polyoxyalkylene-modified organopolysiloxane compound of a specific structure serve as an emulsifying agent or a co-emulsifying agent, a highly polymerized organopolysiloxane can be emulsified and it is possible to blend this organopolysiloxane emulsion composition in both solvent-based and water-based resin compositions and also to impart good slippage. Accordingly, the resin composition of the invention is useful as a surface treatment agent or an internally added treatment agent for synthetic leather and artificial leather intended for use in automobile seats, bags and the like.

The following evaluations of emulsifiability, solvent resistance and slippage were carried out for each of the above Examples and Comparative Examples. The results are shown in Tables 1 to 3.
Emulsifiability:
The emulsifiability of the hydroxydimethyl-terminated polysiloxane at both ends in Examples 1 to 9 and Comparative Examples 1 to 5 was rated according to the following criteria after placing 0.5 g of the sample and 9.5 g of deionized water in a glass bottle, shaking the bottle and examining the appearance of the contents.
◯: Sample is able to disperse in water
×: Sample in unable to disperse in water
Solvent Resistance:
Solvent resistance tests were carried out on Organopolysiloxane Emulsion Compositions A to K.
In the respective tests, Emulsion Compositions A to K in amounts of 0.5 g were placed together with 9.5 g of dimethylformamide (DMF) in a glass bottle, the bottle was shaken and the state of the solution was examined. The solvent resistance was rated according to the following criteria.
◯: The emulsion composition dispersed in DMF with substantially no separation of the organopolysiloxane
Δ: Some of the organopolysiloxane separated out and some of the emulsion composition dispersed in the DMF
×: The DMF broke down the emulsion composition and the organopolysiloxane separated out
Slippage 1:
Slippage Test 1 was carried out on Organopolysiloxane Emulsion Compositions A to K.
Emulsion Compositions A to K were diluted in water so as to form 20 wt % aqueous solutions. Next, 10 g of aqueous acrylic resin (40-418EF, from DIC Corporation) and 0.25 g of 20 wt % aqueous solutions of Emulsion Compositions A to K were placed in glass bottles and uniformly mixed by shaking. The emulsion composition-containing water-based acrylic resins were applied with a No. 3 wire bar onto paperboard (PA2831, from BYK) and dried at room temperature (25° C.) for one hour. The slippage was checked by rubbing the coated surface of the paperboard with a finger and rated according to the criteria shown below.
Slippage 2:
Slippage Test 2 was carried out on Organopolysiloxane Emulsion Compositions A to K.
Emulsion Compositions A to K were diluted with DMF so as to form 20 wt % DMF solutions. In those cases where, during the dilution of Emulsion Compositions A to K in DMF, the emulsion composition broke down and a large amount of silicone separation was observed, Slippage Test 2 was not carried out. Ten grams of a DMF solvent-based polyurethane resin (Sanprene LQ-258, from Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and 0.25 g of Emulsion Compositions A to K were placed in a glass bottle and uniformly mixed by shaking. The emulsion composition-containing solvent-based polyurethane resin was applied with a No. 3 wire bar onto paperboard (PA2831, from BYK) and dried at room temperature (25° C.) for one hour. The slippage was checked by rubbing the coated surface of the paperboard with a finger and rated according to the criteria shown below.
◯: The slippage was better than when Emulsion Composition A to K was not included
Δ: The slippage was the same as when Emulsion Composition A to K was not included
×: The slippage was inferior to when Emulsion Composition A to K was not included, or the organopolysiloxane within the resin separated out
